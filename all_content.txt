London powers ahead with zero-emission buses
#################################################################################

            October 2023        London recently passed a major milestone when it announced more than 1,000 zero-emission buses now operate in its fleetThis article explores how London is achieving a cleaner, greener, and fairer future by investing in a record number of zero-emission buses, creating thousands of good, green jobs, and working with bus manufacturers to improve working conditions in the supply chain.London’s progress in electrifying its bus fleet has been driven by the ambitious policies of its mayor and C40 Chair, Sadiq Khan. Since 2021, the mayor has required that all new buses entering the fleet in London be zero emission. He also set a clear target: by 2034, London aims to have a fully zero-emission bus fleet. This goal could potentially be accelerated to 2030 with more support and funding from the UK’s central government.These policies provided clear direction for Transport for London (TfL), the city’s transport authority. They also signalled to bus operators and manufacturers that London is committed to zero-emission buses. This has encouraged manufacturers, alongside TfL and London bus operators, to develop and roll out zero-emission buses and to invest in the necessary infrastructure to support the vehicles.These targets align with London’s broader ambition to become a net-zero carbon city by 2030. Converting the bus fleet to be entirely zero emission by 2034 will save an estimated 4.8 million tonnes of carbon – this number could rise to 5.5 million tonnes if the goal is achieved by 2030. London’s investment in zero-emission buses is not only making the city greener but also boosting the national green economy. TfL’s investment in zero-emission buses supports around 3,000 green jobs across the UK. By fostering a growing market for zero-emission vehicles, this investment is paving the way for green economic growth and lowering costs for other local authorities through economies of scale.Importantly, London is also taking steps to understand how the raw materials needed for its zero-emission buses, such as cobalt, lithium, tin, and nickel, are sourced. TfL has partnered with the independent monitoring organisation Electronics Watch and ten other European public buying authorities to improve working conditions in its supply chain.By collaborating with vehicle manufacturers, TfL aims to better understand where the batteries for its zero-emission buses are coming from, including information about where raw materials are being sourced and where key components are being manufactured. Electronic Watch’s network will monitor working conditions at certain sites, putting workers’ voices at the centre of monitoring and establishing greater supply chain transparency.London’s journey toward electrifying its bus fleet is a beacon of hope for greener urban transport. The city is reducing carbon emissions while supporting the green economy with ambitious policies, clear targets, and a commitment to ethical supply chains. London’s leadership in investing in zero-emission buses is a prime example of a cleaner, greener, and fairer future for all.<em><sub><strong>1.</strong> As of October 2023, TfL’s bus fleet size was around 8,700 vehicles, of which 1,180 were zero emission.<br/><strong>2.</strong> No emissions produced at the tailpipe.<br/><strong>3.</strong> C40 cities report annually on the number of zero emission buses in the city fleet. Our data is collected confidentially from cities, hence we are unable to make this public. There are currently 18 European cities in the C40 network, including the largest cities in the region.</sub></em>

            October 2023        Tempe, Arizona is a sprawling Phoenix suburb impacted by record-breaking heat and heat-related deaths. In 2023, Phoenix endured the In response to these dangerous temperatures, staff from the City of Tempe’s Office of Sustainability and Resilience united with local high school students and teachers for a project centred on youth education, dialogue, and activism. With support from Arizona State University (ASU) and the Indigenous Design Collaborative, the team worked together to establish Cool Kids, Cool Places, Cool Futures, a project designed to introduce nature-based solutions to help cool the city.Inspired by community-focused youth coalitions in Morocco and The City of Tempe worked with partners to design and implement training sessions for six Summer Youth Fellows from McClintock High School to empower young people to become thought leaders and activists. ASU’s Indigenous Design Collaborative, ASU professors and researchers, and equity consultants co-developed the youth training programme. The training covered the history of Tempe and Indigenous knowledge in city planning decisions, particularly against extreme heat. At the same time, it made space for the young people to express their vision for a more inclusive and resilient city as its future caretakers.The history modules covered how the Native tribes indigenous to Tempe – including Salt-River Pima Maricopa Indian Community, Pascua Yaqui Tribe, and Gila River Indian Community – were systematically oppressed by the Federal government. Some, like the San Pablo Barrio Community, were displaced from their centrally located neighbourhood to La Victoria, a rural, isolated, and disinvested neighbourhood.The training highlighted the environmental injustice of the extreme heat in the neighbourhoods where Indigenous Peoples were displaced to, due to the lack of tree canopy, green spaces, and access to nature. The young people engaged in facilitated dialogue to increase their awareness of the historical and present-day lived realities of Tempe residents and empower them to take action.<strong>School gardens</strong>At one of the project’s partnering schools, McClintockThanks to the Indigenous Design Collective, McClintock students are learning about indigenous growing and farming practices and using this knowledge to build and grow a larger courtyard garden at the school.At Connolly Elementary, teachers and students planted 61 trees of different species that are either native or well-suited for Tempe’s dry heat climate.Building on this success, the City of Tempe’s Sustainability Office has established a formal agreement with the Tempe school district to deepen existing partnerships and form new ones with passionate students, teachers and schools across the city.<strong>Beyond the school gates</strong>Extreme heat impacts are felt most by already vulnerable communities. The project’s members co-hosted an event during the Summer where they distributed ‘Readi Pack’ kits to unhoused people to help cope with the heat. The kits included a reusable water bottle, a cooling towel, sunblock, a collapsible bowl, wet wipes, and a transit pass in a reusable bag.Through the Cool Kids, Cool Places, Cool Futures project, the visionary leaders at City of Tempe’s Sustainability Office, Arizona State University, and Tempe school students and teachers have raised awareness about environmental justice, and empowered young people to be advocates and changemakers. Together, they have instituted initiatives at the city level to make Tempe a more equitable, green, and cool place to be.<strong><a href="https://www.c40.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tempe_Cool-Kids-Cool-Places-Cool-Futures-in-Tempe-Final_in-depth.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Learn more about Cool Kids, Cool Places, Cool Futures in Tempe</a></strong><em>Support for this project was provided by the </em>

Lawrence Pa’lante: Safer Cooler Streets
#################################################################################

            October 2023        The landscape of Lawrence, Massachusetts, is made up of surfaces that retain heat, such as concrete pavements and buildings. Combined with few green spaces and a heating climate, this creates the ‘urban heat island’ effect. As heat impacts the most vulnerable populations, like the elderly, low-income and outdoor workers, and the chronically ill, many Lawrence residents are at high risk of suffering from extreme heat.Public transit options in Lawrence are also limited, meaning long walks without much shade. This pushes many people to drive cars, increasing pollution and reducing people’s physical activity. Due to a combination of factors, Lawrence residents experience many health challenges.Lawrence Pa’lante: Safer Cooler Streets is a collaborative project designed to address these connected challenges. Led by the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF), Groundwork Lawrence, and the Pa’lante means to “go forward” both literally and metaphorically. This captures the focus of the task force and is an ode to the community of Lawrence, the vast majority of whom have Puerto Rican, Dominican, or other Latin American heritage. The term has historically been used among young activist circles resisting oppressive policies, inspiring hope and community. Out of this spirit, the Pa’lante resident taskforce was born. <strong>Creating a ‘cool island’</strong>A ‘cool island’ is a central meeting place featuring safe walkable areas, shaded streets, and essential services for residents. A heat map was used to understand which areas of Lawrence would benefit from a ‘cool island’.The ‘Bennington Triangle’ – a once abandoned gas station and informal parking space – was chosen as a perfect location for a pilot, close to schools and homes.Groundwork Lawrence, CLF, and the Pa’lante resident taskforce transformed the area into a vibrant community park and meeting place. The team hosted the ‘Bennington Pop-Up’ for a weekend, creating a green space with free food, plants, seats, picnic tables and city buses for people to try. Some residents rarely, if ever, have ridden the bus in Lawrence. After encouraging feedback from residents, Groundwork Lawrence and community volunteers kept the green space open through winter.One year later, the weekend ‘pop-up’ is still there.

Detroit Composting for Community Health
#################################################################################

            October 2023        Detroit Composting for Community Health is a series of composting pilot projects around Detroit led by community leaders and community-based organisations, including Eastside Community Network, Georgia Street Community Collective (GSCC), FoodPLUS Detroit, Sustainable Community Farms, and Breathe Free Detroit. Together, these organisations are working to increase access to urban farming and composting to improve quality of life for people living in some of Detroit’s most polluted areas.<strong>Detroit Community Compost Training Programme</strong>The Sustainable Community Farm provides a green haven for residents. The Farm hosts community events like Juneteenth celebrations and movie nights, as well as being a centre for farming, composting, and growing healthy crops from rich soil.The Sustainable Community Farm hosts the ‘Detroit Community Compost’ training programme to equip young people aged 16–24 with urban farming and composting knowledge. The programme provides an entryway for those not currently in school or employment into good green jobs that contribute to environmental sustainability.  In partnership with Marvin Hayes, an expert and leader in composting efforts in Baltimore, the young people in the programme will be visiting <strong>People’s Compost Initiative</strong>The Georgia Street Community Collective (GSCC) in the east side of Detroit and community non-profit FoodPlus Detroit have expanded their urban farming and composting efforts to train up members of the community. The ‘People’s Compost Initiative’ offers compost training and demonstrations for people of all ages. So far, they have equipped over 70 people with compost skills and knowledge across Detroit.<strong>Compost Warriors at Wayne State University</strong>Wayne State University, one of the leading higher education institutions in Detroit and in Michigan, has been transformed into a waste-conscious and sustainable campus through a strong partnership between FoodPLUS Detroit and Georgia Street Community Collective (GSCC).The ’Compost Warriors’ programme involves composting and sustainability training sessions for students, empowering them to be ambassadors on their campus. The students were trained to conduct quality control checks on the food scraps collected from the cafeteria and retail outlets and to weigh, document, and transport collections to the GSCC farm for composting. Each year, they have rescued an average of 16,000 lbs of food waste – totalling 40,000 lbs to date – to be transformed into rich compost for the urban farm. Now, there’s a campus-wide composting collection system, dining services have information about composting front and centre in the dining hall, and the head chef is exploring the possibility of collaborating with GSCC to grow farm-fresh ingredients to feed students on campus.Through these various approaches to urban farming and composting, community leaders and compost advocates have empowered Detroit residents and students to farm, compost, and come together to cultivate healthy food and vibrant community spaces.<strong><a href="https://www.c40.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Detroit_Detroit-Composting-for-Community-Health-Final_in-depth.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Learn more about Detroit Composting for Community Health</a></strong><em>Support for this project was provided by the </em>

Detroit Composting for Community Health
#################################################################################

            October 2023        Detroit Composting for Community Health is a series of composting pilot projects around Detroit led by community leaders and community-based organisations, including Eastside Community Network, Georgia Street Community Collective (GSCC), FoodPLUS Detroit, Sustainable Community Farms, and Breathe Free Detroit. Together, these organisations are working to increase access to urban farming and composting to improve quality of life for people living in some of Detroit’s most polluted areas.<strong>Detroit Community Compost Training Programme</strong>The Sustainable Community Farm provides a green haven for residents. The Farm hosts community events like Juneteenth celebrations and movie nights, as well as being a centre for farming, composting, and growing healthy crops from rich soil.The Sustainable Community Farm hosts the ‘Detroit Community Compost’ training programme to equip young people aged 16–24 with urban farming and composting knowledge. The programme provides an entryway for those not currently in school or employment into good green jobs that contribute to environmental sustainability.  In partnership with Marvin Hayes, an expert and leader in composting efforts in Baltimore, the young people in the programme will be visiting <strong>People’s Compost Initiative</strong>The Georgia Street Community Collective (GSCC) in the east side of Detroit and community non-profit FoodPlus Detroit have expanded their urban farming and composting efforts to train up members of the community. The ‘People’s Compost Initiative’ offers compost training and demonstrations for people of all ages. So far, they have equipped over 70 people with compost skills and knowledge across Detroit.<strong>Compost Warriors at Wayne State University</strong>Wayne State University, one of the leading higher education institutions in Detroit and in Michigan, has been transformed into a waste-conscious and sustainable campus through a strong partnership between FoodPLUS Detroit and Georgia Street Community Collective (GSCC).The ’Compost Warriors’ programme involves composting and sustainability training sessions for students, empowering them to be ambassadors on their campus. The students were trained to conduct quality control checks on the food scraps collected from the cafeteria and retail outlets and to weigh, document, and transport collections to the GSCC farm for composting. Each year, they have rescued an average of 16,000 lbs of food waste – totalling 40,000 lbs to date – to be transformed into rich compost for the urban farm. Now, there’s a campus-wide composting collection system, dining services have information about composting front and centre in the dining hall, and the head chef is exploring the possibility of collaborating with GSCC to grow farm-fresh ingredients to feed students on campus.Through these various approaches to urban farming and composting, community leaders and compost advocates have empowered Detroit residents and students to farm, compost, and come together to cultivate healthy food and vibrant community spaces.<strong><a href="https://www.c40.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Detroit_Detroit-Composting-for-Community-Health-Final_in-depth.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Learn more about Detroit Composting for Community Health</a></strong><em>Support for this project was provided by the </em>

ICA Fund | Addressing energy poverty by supporting low-income residents to retrofit
#################################################################################

            June 2023        Transitioning from coal to renewable energy is a priority for the City of Warsaw. Poland’s national government has committed to removing coal from its energy systems by 2050. However, fossil fuels Social housing in Warsaw tends to be energy inefficient; the buildings lose heat, generally rely on coal power, and they house lower-income residents more likely to experience financial burdens. The city made some progress in this area; due to Warsaw’s anti-smog programme, around 85% of municipal buildings have replaced coal boilers with district heating, gas heating, heat pumps or electric heating sources. However, further efforts are needed to make social housing more energy efficient and reduce energy use and demand. Delaying investment in social housing risks pushing the most vulnerable in Warsaw to energy poverty while increasing the chances of subsequent health and safety issues.Additionally, data on the housing stock’s energy efficiency and tenants’ sociodemographic and economic circumstances are inconsistent. These data are critical, as they will facilitate consultation processes and improve the effectiveness of investments in social housing renovations that seek to improve energy efficiency, such as retrofitting. Since 2021, C40 has supported Warsaw in undertaking energy audits and installing new heating units in targeted low-income homes, and developing socio-political analyses that provide the city with critical insight into the policy measures to use to better engage vulnerable tenants and give the support they need to switch to clean heating sources.<strong>Building on this, the city will utilise the C40 Inclusive Climate Action (ICA) Cities Fund grant to kick-start the Carbon-neutral and Affordable Retrofits for Everyone in Need (CARE) project. The project will organise data around energy efficiency, classify buildings, and prioritise them according to climate and social criteria to help the city identify where renovation investments will have the best effect – both from environmental and social perspectives. </strong>The project will continue supporting the city’s vision of reducing energy poverty among urban dwellers, improving housing conditions, health and well-being, and ensuring cost-effective climate mitigation.The C40 Inclusive Climate Action (ICA) Cities Fund is designed to help cities develop and implement climate projects with equity and inclusion principles at their core.

Transforming Cities: How cities can use data to track their climate goals
#################################################################################

            May 2023        When “Portlanders are feeling the impacts of a changing climate,” says Portland has been in the avant-garde of climate mitigation since adopting its climate action plan in 1993, which has been followed by an updated 2015 plan, and a 2022 Climate Emergency Workplan. “People move to Portland for that environmental ethic – to be in a city that’s close to nature, that has an urban growth boundary that prevents sprawl,” says Diesner.But the progress made presents new challenges to responding to climate change today. “So much of the low-hanging fruit, the easier things, the incentives, the voluntary changes, has already been put in place. We’re getting to a point where each of the things we have to do ahead of us are much heavier and more challenging to do,” says Diesner.One of the challenges with prioritising action on the climate is that there are many other competing issues. Diesner cites challenges like homelessness, housing affordability and crime in Portland. To support more climate commitments, cities need buy-in from residents and businesses – and this often requires evidence.“Fortunately, we have been able to use data to help tell that story. Since 1993, we’ve been tracking our local carbon emissions, and we’ve seen those emissions decline,” says Diesner. “Today, they’re 25% below where they were in 1990, even though we’ve added about 39% more people.”Other cities are following Portland’s lead. Faced with similar challenges of how to prioritise their actions, they need data to be accessible and understandable.Data is a critical tool to help us understand climate change, by monitoring temperature trends and frequency of climate events. If data is relevant and accessible it helps create action, says “I think it’s incredibly important for people everywhere to have access to good, reliable data because we need that in order to properly understand how grave and great and urgent a problem climate change is,” agrees In partnership with Qlik, C40 has developed an engagement dashboard to help cities actively share successes and learn from each other – such as documenting best practices, presenting at webinars, or directly mentoring other cities. The dashboards can help cities see where they stand on key metrics and benchmark themselves against city peers, with the aim of improving decision-making and accelerating the policies and investments necessary to prevent more catastrophic consequences of climate change.Kae says that making data accessible to both the public and the private sector can facilitate collaboration. “We worked on a project that included a non-profit which had information with regards to water accessibility in and around the Amazon River,” she says. “There are a number of private sector companies that need – and have rights to – more water from the Amazon than [they are currently able to access.”By taking freshwater availability data and combining it with consumption needs, it was possible to see how the private companies were able to cooperate. “Only [when you share data] can you come to the table and have a conversation about collaborating to protect that vital resource,” says Kae.This collaboration can extend out from city to city too. The Colombian city of Like many cities, the energy crisis has drawn attention on how to reduce energy waste in Medellín. Carlos Alberto Bohorquez Gutierrez, an environmental planning coordinator for the Municipality of Medellín, says that The consequences of not adapting to climate change for a city like Medellín could be severe, says Gutierrez. The city has suffered from devastating floods and landslides in recent years, which destroy infrastructure and bring the city to a standstill.“We need to build different adaptations, to… protect us, especially in the transportation system,” he says. “Our metro is an internationally-recognised, integrated transport infrastructure. But in an extreme situation, such as heavy rain or flooding, the metro could be paralysed and thus paralyse the cable car systems. So, these adaptations in the works would control flooding and urban drainage.”It’s important to understand where cities can have the most impact, what the biggest sources of emissions are, and the climate risks that they need to mitigate and manage. “Given the scale and urgency of the climate crisis, we simply can’t afford not to be having that maximum impact,” says Huxley.Portland, for example, is now starting to look at emissions data with a different lens – consumption-based emissions, which are the emissions that are produced globally as a result of Portlanders spending on goods and services, materials, food, and to build buildings. These are not always accounted for in traditional carbon accounting.“We’re making great progress reducing emissions locally,” says Diesner. “But, we’ve seen consumption-based emissions rise. [So] we’ve advanced a lot of work around reuse and repair [with] our repair cafes, tool libraries, fix-it fairs, we’re really helping residents better utilise, maintain, and keep in use the goods that they do have today.”Because the low-hanging fruit has already been picked, Diesner says that the focus is now on climate justice, resilience and the impact climate change has on communities. “This allows us to make sure that we help those who most often get left behind – people with low incomes, certainly people of colour in the US – they’re traditionally the ones who don’t have the resources to make changes or to live healthy lives and easily adapt.”Diesner is optimistic that other cities are not far behind their lead. He hopes that people will learn from their 30-year journey and perhaps make the same transition in less time. “It’s exciting to see how this movement has really grown, compared to where we were in 2015, when we were the only city asking those questions.”This content was produced for Qlik by BBC StoryWorks as part of the Transforming Cities series presented by C40 Cities.

Transforming Cities: The city addressing inequality by connecting communities
#################################################################################

            November 2022        When a city is better connected, all residents benefit. Connectivity can reduce inequity, mitigate climate change and repair communities. But in the US, the challenge for some cities is how to undo historical inequity. Discriminatory housing practices separated Austin along racial divides – the effects of which are still felt today. But Austin is attempting to address injustices and create opportunities with a new transport network and an unprecedented $300m (£260m) anti-displacement investment. Project Connect is a new light rail and bus network designed to connect neighbourhoods around Austin. It aims to improve access to daily needs like jobs, healthcare and education. As well as connecting neighbourhoods, by reducing people’s reliance on cars, the project also aims to play a role in tackling Austin’s carbon footprint – reducing community-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by around 250,000 tonnes per year and helping the City of Austin to reach its goal of net-zero emissions by 2040.Six Austinites from different and diverse communities, who are united by their care for the future of the city, describe their hopes to bring communities back together, improve transit, and address climate change.Yasmine Smith is a proud born-and-raised Austinite. She’s also an attorney and through her work with PUMA is working to ensure Project Connect will use transportation as a tool for equity. “Transportation is the difference between someone having access to fresh food or living in a food desert,” says Smith. And having reliable transportation can even mean that young people have the opportunity to access higher education instead of succumbing to a “school-to-prison pipeline”, she explains.The racially segregating 1928 “Master Plan” forcibly moved black and brown communities to the eastern part of the city and divided them from the white west. The east side was the underinvested, industrial part of the city, while the west attracted the white, wealthy and better educated. Today, life expectancies on the west side of the city are up to 10 years higher than in some eastern postcodes. More recently, eastern neighbourhoods have been gentrified, with higher rents and new developments displacing the original communities. Smith says displacement can be tied to transport developments.“Historically, when bus lines or bike lanes come, that’s a signal of displacement.”Designed in partnership with impacted community members, PUMA advocated for the $300m-anti-displacement investments and supported the creation of an “Equity Assessment Tool” in order to guide decisions being made on Project Connect and ensure support is given to those living near proposed stations so they aren’t displaced. Hear Yasmine Smith explain why this municipal project felt different:Robin Rather runs her own sustainability consultancy and is part of a team intent on the ecological restoration of Zilker Park – home to a world-famous natural swimming spot. She says Austin needs ecological reform, having recently experienced wildfires, floods, rising temperatures and rising GHGs from vehicles. Having lived in Austin for most of her life, the biggest change she’s seen is the “excruciating degree of traffic” which has come with Austin’s accelerated growth. The city is one of the most car congested in the US – Meanwhile, light rail produces Austin FC fans are taking the city’s existing rail line in significantly growing numbers – one of a number of groups of residents and visitors who have enjoyed riding, and celebrating, on the train:Veronica Castro de Barrera’s passion for mobility and urban design started when she moved to the US from Mexico City aged 13. In her hometown she was free to play in the streets or walk to school with her friends.But when Castro de Barrera moved to the US, she often found herself walking along roads that weren’t designed with pedestrians in mind, making her feel vulnerable. She later enrolled in architecture school to learn how to make cities more welcoming and healthier for their inhabitants.One of the main challenges for Austin is the urban sprawl. People make long commutes from home to work, and it can be difficult for businesses to recruit staff. She hopes that Project Connect is going to “stitch the city together” and that Austinites will pivot away from their current car culture.Listen to Veronica Castro de Barrera describe the perfect 15-minute city:With climate change already bringing longer, hotter summers, as well as more severe rain events and flooding, creeks are vitally important in a semi-arid area like Austin, says Ana Gonzalez. Creeks function as cooling networks in the long hot summers. Trees and plants that grow along banks provide shade and absorb water, which then evaporates from their leaves, acting like a natural air conditioner. Healthy watersheds, where rain infiltrates into the soil to sustain plants also have this effect and support healthy creeks. They help to mitigate the “urban heat island” effect, a phenomenon where urban areas have higher temperatures than their rural surroundings, and provide corridors of refuge to wildlife during drought.“Heat stress is a significant human health issue,” says Gonzalez.An infrastructure change like Project Connect needs to incorporate and protect Austin’s many ecologically vibrant creeks. For example, creating bridges that span a creek, she says, is better than roads that pave over the creek with a large pipe for the water to flow through instead. In the audio below, Ana Gonzalez describes how the city’s creeks can be incorporated into Project Connect:“Race is the single biggest predictor of quality of life in the US,” says Shane Johnson, who was a co-chair on the steering committee for Austin’s Climate Equity Plan, which grounds Austin’s climate change policies firmly in racial equity. “We don’t want to be just addressing the symptoms of climate change. We want to address how [climate change] is rooted in systemic racism.”Currently, transport is Austin’s Project Connect – which will provide alternatives to driving across the city and is aiming for half of journeys to be made without cars – is crucial in meeting the city’s climate goals. But it will also need to avoid the displacement of vulnerable neighbourhoods and neighbourhoods of colour, and ensure that those who are displaced also benefit from the public transit investment.Black Star, the world’s first community-owned brewpub, has already benefitted from Austin’s commuter rail line which created a transit-oriented hub in an area that previously had very little development, connecting it to the rest of the city and allowing businesses to spring up. Ouellette, who moved to Austin in 1996, has seen that growth firsthand, and although he’s not complaining, he feels such quick growth has changed Austin and changed the vibe.“That’s the compromise you make with a growing city, things are going to change,” he says. Although he is anxious about the disruption of construction, he hopes Project Connect will bring back a more connected, small-town feel. And while Austin continues to grow, so too will a sense of community.Project Connect aims to reduce avoidable vehicle journeys by 109 million miles annually. As the population of the area is set to double by 2040, reducing the climate impact of travel in the city is critical to its sustainable growth. Improving the car-free travel options will benefit residents’ health, jobs and education. These six Austinites are all hopeful that this project will also bring their city together.“I love that they call it Project Connect, because when you’re riding a bus or a train, you are meeting people you wouldn’t normally otherwise meet,” concludes environmentalist This content was produced for the City of Austin by BBC StoryWorks as part of the Transforming Cities series presented by C40 Cities.

C40-Bloomberg Philanthropies Awards: Safeguarding Lisbon's drinking water to improve water security and circularity
#################################################################################

            October 2022        Climate breakdown is causing more frequent and severe heat waves, changing rainfall patterns and water scarcity in Lisbon. The city is responding to this threat by recycling water from three treatment plants, providing potable water and ensuring residents have reliable access to clean and safe drinking water.Lisbon currently uses 75% of its drinking water reserves for non-potable uses such as irrigation and street cleaning. To reduce this, the city has invested €20 billion in creating a 55-kilometre-long reclaimed water distribution network; 8.6 kilometres are already built. The city is also introducing water circularity through its Wastewater Reuse Plan; the initiative will reuse more than 1 million mLower tariffs are in place for recycled water compared with drinking water, enabling Lisbon to save €26.8 million by 2030, and the city has already saved almost €3 million due to the initiative.The city estimates the programme will reduce drinking water use for non-potable purposes by 69% and water-related emissions by 50% compared with 2020 levels, thereby preventing water scarcity while protecting the public and environment’s health. The Wastewater Reuse Plan effectively educates residents on the issue of water scarcity and receives strong public support.This case study was originally published for the 2022 C40 Cities Bloomberg Philanthropies Awards, which recognise ambitious and impactful projects led by mayors that address climate challenges.

            October 2022        Globally, exposure to air pollution causes more early deaths than malaria and HIV combined. In 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) The project’s launch saw the installation of low-cost air quality sensors at schools, children’s health centres and shelters to measure the levels of air pollution, enabling the city to monitor local air quality. This data helped Lima to introduce measures that reduce children’s exposure to dangerous air pollutants, creating safe spaces with cleaner air for children to play, learn, develop and thrive.To date, the project has increased air quality monitoring coverage in the city by nearly two-thirds. The data has enabled Lima to identify where to implement actions to improve air quality; over 8,000 children have benefited from measures such as accessible pathways and playgrounds that are far from busy traffic routes and have increased vegetation cover, helping to remove pollutants from the air. The measures have also improved air quality by 45% in the targeted locations. The project expects to reduce the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular disease by nearly 30%, and increase life expectancy by more than 11 months. The project is supported by This case study was originally published for the 2022 C40 Cities Bloomberg Philanthropies Awards, which recognise ambitious and impactful projects led by mayors that address climate challenges.

Due to this, Wuhan is particularly vulnerable to flooding and rainstorms, posing a serious threat to urban security. The city is taking action to upgrade 396 kilometres of shorelines of the Yangtze River Economic Belt to improve flood control capacity and the area’s ecological, cultural, and landscape functions, as it is a vital region for trade along China’s rivers.The city is also implementing a flood control system, strengthening disaster prevention by improving flood-control measures, drainage facilities and expanding rainwater-pumping stations. Wuhan will build an ecological corridor that connects the river and city to enhance urban greening and water quality, and a cultural corridor to showcase historical features.By the end of 2021, Wuhan created 638 hectares of wetlands, with an estimated 196.4 hectares of existing green areas renovated, resulting in increased biodiversity and carbon sinks.

C40-Bloomberg Philanthropies Awards: GrowQC: food security for Quezon residents
#################################################################################

            October 2022        In Quezon City, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated widespread hunger and malnutrition. The city launched GrowQC to tackle the growing problem of food insecurity amongst the most vulnerable residents. The initiative aims to make healthy and nutritious food available to all and create inclusive and sustainable livelihoods for vulnerable groups by converting idle lands across the city into productive, green and local urban farms, reducing transport and agriculture-related emissions.From the start of the pandemic to 2022, GrowQC has established a total of 337 urban gardens and ten model farms, creating livelihoods for 4,119 urban farmers, 258 displaced workers and 298 vendors and jeepney drivers. Private landowners were exempt from paying Idle Land Tax if they allowed their land to be utilised in the project for three years, effectively increasing the city’s access to land; a total of 381,650 m2 of land was converted for urban agriculture.During the city’s most intense lockdown in 2021, GrowQC ensured 1.7 million healthy and nutritious meals were served to 325,600 families. Around 3,600 residents, previously on low or zero incomes, have been trained as city farmers to produce food and boost their income. Direct access to fresh and affordable food has benefited the health and wellbeing of communities that experienced food insecurity. The project promotes a circular economy by exemplifying the farm-to-table and waste-to-energy cycle, serving as an integrated food system that is sustainable and replicable to other cities.This case study was originally published for the 2022 C40 Cities Bloomberg Philanthropies Awards, which recognise ambitious and impactful projects led by mayors that address climate challenges.

#################################################################################

            October 2022        Climate breakdown is causing more frequent and severe heat waves, changing rainfall patterns and water scarcity in Lisbon. The city is responding to this threat by recycling water from three treatment plants, providing potable water and ensuring residents have reliable access to clean and safe drinking water.Lisbon currently uses 75% of its drinking water reserves for non-potable uses such as irrigation and street cleaning. To reduce this, the city has invested €20 billion in creating a 55-kilometre-long reclaimed water distribution network; 8.6 kilometres are already built. The city is also introducing water circularity through its Wastewater Reuse Plan; the initiative will reuse more than 1 million mLower tariffs are in place for recycled water compared with drinking water, enabling Lisbon to save €26.8 million by 2030, and the city has already saved almost €3 million due to the initiative.The city estimates the programme will reduce drinking water use for non-potable purposes by 69% and water-related emissions by 50% compared with 2020 levels, thereby preventing water scarcity while protecting the public and environment’s health. The Wastewater Reuse Plan effectively educates residents on the issue of water scarcity and receives strong public support.This case study was originally published for the 2022 C40 Cities Bloomberg Philanthropies Awards, which recognise ambitious and impactful projects led by mayors that address climate challenges.

C40-Bloomberg Philanthropies Awards: Advancing air quality monitoring and community engagement in Quito
#################################################################################

            October 2022        Quito experiences unsafe levels of air pollution due to petrol and diesel vehicles emitting toxic gases into the air. Pollution exposure negatively affects local economies and the health of residents through lost working days, increased hospital admissions and associated medical costs. These impacts affect Quito’s low-income and vulnerable communities the most, as the areas with the cleanest air are often the most expensive to reside in.To address this, Quito has introduced an air quality monitoring network that combines low-cost sensors and monitoring stations in residents’ homes, engaging locals with the air quality challenge. The city has installed stations in all 32 parishes, prioritising neighbourhoods with high numbers of migrants and young children. The data generated by the network has allowed the city to identify hotspots and times of day when air pollution is at its worst, enabling the city to take action accordingly. New mandatory vehicle inspections have led to the removal of 125,000 high-polluting cars from the streets, resulting in a 20% reduction in COThis case study was originally published for the 2022 C40 Cities Bloomberg Philanthropies Awards, which recognise ambitious and impactful projects led by mayors that address climate challenges.

C40-Bloomberg Philanthropies Awards: Engaging community leaders to cool Irvine
#################################################################################

            October 2022        California is at risk of coastal flooding, habitat destruction and wildfires; Irvine is taking a holistic, grassroots approach at the block-level to tackle these threats and improve community climate resilience.In 2021, the city collaborated with 25 community-led organisations to engage residents in making climate pledges a reality, recruiting over 200 block leaders to guide community efforts. The pledges include introducing energy and water conservation measures, shifting to a planet-friendly diet, switching to cycling or walking, retrofitting homes, and creating disaster evacuation plans/kits. The city launched a pilot programme offering grants up to US $1,000 and no-interest loans of US $25,000 to help finance home upgrades that improve sustainability and resilience in Irvine’s oldest neighbourhoods.Community-building and connecting with residents who are traditionally excluded from the climate conversation is a core part of the initiative. So far, more than 180 ethnically diverse Irvine households are taking part in the Cool Block programme. Together, they have pledged over 1,800 actions and taken 1,385 measures to reduce emissions. The measures have resulted in a reduction of nearly 250 tonnes of CO2 emissions, bringing Irvine a step closer to its goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2030 – 15 years before the rest of the state of California.This case study was originally published for the 2022 C40 Cities Bloomberg Philanthropies Awards, which recognise ambitious and impactful projects led by mayors that address climate challenges.

            October 2022        Back in 2016, more than 240,000 people in the City of Buenos Aires lived in neighbourhoods considered vulnerable to climate breakdown. These areas were deemed at risk due to high population density, poor clean air circulation and basic infrastructure, and a lack of green space that contributed to the “urban heat island” effect.Rodrigo Bueno was at particular risk due to its location; situated in the 1° Comuna, an area that borders the The Buenos Aires City Housing Institute recognised this and, from 2017, began working with Rodrigo Bueno residents to sustainably develop the area, improve residents’ quality of life, and enhance the area’s climate resilience. Locals were involved in all stages of the project’s development to ensure changes to the area served their needs, and those living in areas most at risk of flooding and environmental degradation were rehoused as a priority.<strong>Watch the video below to learn about the project:</strong><strong>Maria Migliore, Human Development and Habitat Office Secretary</strong>“Everyday, we choose to transform the reality of the people who live in Buenos Aires.

Buenos Aires’ Circular Economy Network
#################################################################################

            September 2022        In Buenos Aires, around 7,500 tonnes of waste are processed each day. In line with the city’s climate action plan and to achieve its goal of becoming carbon neutral, more resilient and inclusive by 2050, Buenos Aires is aiming for 80% of the city to recycle by 2023.To be successful, this ambitious goal requires engagement from both businesses and residents. Therefore, the city has developed a circular economy model centered on co-creating impactful solutions. The city collaborates with stakeholders from all sectors of society to encourage cultural change, reduce the amount of waste generated, promote proper material separation, and more effectively recover waste that can be processed and reused.Launched in 2021, the city’s Circular Economy Network is a The network’s activities are complemented by the Sello Verde (“Green Seal”) certification, which recognises regulatory compliance and ambitious waste management practices in public and private offices, commercial premises and residential buildings. A total of 142 institutions have already been recognised, including the Banco Itaú, which obtained the Green Seal for all its offices and ten public locations. The certification lasts one year and is reviewed to assess continued compliance.“Since we launched the BA Recicla Plan a year ago, our key objectives have been to involve all sectors and promote responsible consumption, recycling and the reuse of resources in industry. Today, there are already more than 280 organisations in the Circular Economy Network, reflecting the broad teamwork between the public and private sectors”, said All collected dry recyclables are sent to the city’s Green Centres, where waste cooperatives sort and process the materials and then return them to industry for reuse. An example of this process is the renovation of the Puente de la Mujer’s floor. At this iconic location in Buenos Aires, the floor was restored and transformed using plastic wood, recovered from 100,000 bottles filled with single-use plastic. This material is more resistant, durable and requires less maintenance than traditional wood. Its use here is only possible thanks to residents’ and businesses’ effective separation of waste materials.The replaced wood also benefits from an extended lifespan; following its removal from the Puente de la Mujer, it was transformed into furniture for the Piedrabuenarte Cultural Centre in the south of the city.Reducing waste and increasing recycling and the reuse of materials is easier when the required infrastructure and cultural habits are in place. Buenos Aires has been working towards this for many years, with the goal of transforming its waste management capacity. For example, in 2015, the city recorded that 35% of residents routinely recycled; by 2022, that number increased to more than 50%.The city fulfilled two key commitments to achieve this. Between 2016 and 2019, Buenos Aires doubled its recycling capacity from 400 to 800 tonnes per day and implemented a separated waste system with door-to-door collection. The city also introduced 16 green centres and a recycling centre that manages and treats different waste materials, including:In addition, in 2021, the city fulfilled its commitment to ensuring that 100% of Buenos Aires residents can access a green recycling bin within 150 metres of their homes.The city also introduced regulations to limit single-use plastics. The Plastic Bag Disposal Law reduced bag deliveries to the city’s shops by more than 500 million bags annually, and the Resolution to Prohibit the Use, Delivery and Sale of Plastic Straws has eliminated 2 million straws per month.Improvements to the city’s recycling and waste processing infrastructure are effectively combined with initiatives that raise awareness of and promote Buenos Aires’ circular economy. For example, the city’s BA Recicla Plan encourages waste separation and drives improvements for the city’s Green Centres. The Recicla Plan also reinforces the work of the Circular Economy Network and Green City Ambassadors, to improve recycling rates and compliance with sustainable regulations among both residents and the private sector.<strong>All photos courtesy of the City of Buenos Aires.</strong><em>This article was originally produced as a “Spaces in the City” feature for the C40 World Mayors Summit 2022 hosted by the City of Buenos Aires.</em>

            August 2022        <br/>The city of Buenos Aires has been working to transform itself into a wellbeing city, where residents can access all the services, shops and green spaces they need within a short walk or bicycle ride away from their homes. A wellbeing city is designed with pedestrians, wheelchair users and cyclists in mind, rather than prioritising cars, trucks and other vehicles. This results in better air quality, greener and healthier streets, and well-connected communities. “Buenos Aires has committed to become a carbon neutral, resilient and inclusive city by 2050 – an initiative promoted and supported by C40. To meet these targets, we have a 2050 Climate Action Plan that establishes actions, tools and strategies for adaptation and mitigation to climate change so as to reduce human vulnerability and natural systems”, said In order to become a carbon neutral city by 2050, Buenos Aires is focusing on improving public transport and encouraging cycling. The transport sector is responsible for Over the past 10 years, Buenos Aires has transformed public transportation. This can be seen most clearly in the introduction of the Metrobús network, which now includes seven corridors of exclusive lanes for buses, with one more under construction. These corridors allow for efficient, comfortable and safe journeys for over 1 million passengers daily.  The network covers The subway is an essential way of getting around the city, and another key focus of public transport improvements in Buenos Aires. Over the last 12 years, the city government has made significant investments in the network. There are now 14 new subway stations, an additional 18 kilometres on the network, more frequent and newer trains, more security cameras, and free Wi-Fi access in all stations. More than 850,000 daily trips are made on the subway in Buenos Aires. To reduce transport emissions and improve air quality, more people need to be out of their cars and on their bikes. The City of Buenos Aires is making it easier and more accessible for cyclists to move around the city.

Costanera Sur, Lugano Lake and Costanera Norte-Ciudad Universitaria
#################################################################################

            July 2022        <br/>Costanera Sur was the first site in Buenos Aires to be designated a protected area; thanks to more than 36 years of conservation and restoration, the site now covers 350 hectares and is the most biodiverse space in the city.The area’s rich biodiversity is exemplified by the presence of the Argentine Flag butterfly, previously thought to be extinct, which was discovered at the reserve in 2016. In light of this, the city is supporting efforts to increase the population of this rare species. The reserve borders the Río de la Plata and has four interior lagoons, as well as a variety of walking trails for public use.Until the 1970s, this space functioned as a municipal beach resort, but it was set to be redeveloped to serve as the administrative centre of the City of Buenos Aires. To accommodate the project, developers began dumping rubble at the site to increase land and push back the river, but it was eventually abandoned.In time, nature began to reclaim the space. Following a series of floods at the site, diverse natural environments formed; local environmental groups recognised this in 1985 and began to deliver educational activities at Costanera Sur. Then, on 5 June 1986, the space was officially declared an ecological reserve.The area has continued to flourish, providing environmental and community benefits for city residents — fauna, flora and humans alike. In 2005, the Ramsar Convention recognised the Costanera Sur reserve as a ‘Ramsar Site’, an important international designation, while BirdLife International and Aves Argentinas formally recognised the space as an ‘Important Bird Conservation Area’ in 2005.Located on the southern bank of the Cildañez stream, on an old meander of the Riachuelo, the nature reserve at Lugano Lake has a rich landscape covered by exotic and native trees. The space spans 36 hectares and features areas dedicated to restoring species typical of the Paraná Delta and islands of the Argentine Espinal Ecoregion.Since 2013, vegetation control and infrastructure development have been active in the space to conserve the natural environment and native flora. It was officially recognised as a protected area by the City of Buenos Aires in 2018.With the city’s support, Lugano Lake sustains a diverse flora and fauna that includes more than 20 species of butterflies, 118 species of birds and more than 120 types of plants.A species of particular note is the Orquídea del Talar, which grows on the shores of the lake and the Cildañez stream and has become an iconic feature of the reserve. This orchid species was once considered extinct, but was identified in the area during a survey of the local vegetation in 2015.The Costanera Norte-Ciudad Universitaria ecological reserve consists of a conservation area spanning 14 hectares and an urban park for city residents and visitors covering 9 hectares.Costanera Norte is located in an area originally covered by the Río de la Plata. In the 1960s, development work was carried out to infill the land using the river’s sediments, thereby enabling rededication of the space.Following this, in the 1970s, an islet was built parallel to the coast to join the space to the mainland at the south, sitting at the height of Pavilion 2 of the Ciudad Universitaria.During the 1990s, natural landscapes quickly began to form along the new coastal strip. The space now comprises grasslands, forests and wetlands predominately containing exotic species of flora, though the wetland features an abundance of native species.<strong>Inés Gorbea, the Secretary of Environment for the City of Buenos Aires</strong>The spaces attract around 1 million visitors each year, making them an important source of eco-tourism that helps support local jobs, businesses and the economy. They also contribute to the resilience of nearby communities and provide access to nature, improving the quality of life of all Buenos Aires residents.<em>This article was originally produced as a “Spaces in the City” feature for the C40 World Mayors Summit 2022 hosted by the City of Buenos Aires.</em>

Kuala Lumpur as a Climate-Smart and Low Carbon City
#################################################################################

            October 2021        Urban planning in Kuala Lumpur today works to create a city that is able to withstand the effects of climate change and reduce risks from disasters. Based on the Kuala Lumpur Low Carbon Society Blueprint of 2030, the reduction of carbon emissions in the power generation sector and the improvements to energy efficiency are expected to contribute as much as 70% of overall carbon mitigation potential in Kuala Lumpur in 2030. Kuala Lumpur as a climate-smart and low carbon city strengthens the resolve of Kuala Lumpur to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transform into a low carbon global city that efficiently manages resources (particularly on the aspects of green transportation), solid waste, water, and energy. This will encourage infrastructure development that is resilient and climate-smart. Indirectly, it enhances competence and livability to drive future green growth. The blueprint focuses on planning, management, and development. The development includes mitigation measures, adaptation to the effects of natural disasters and climate change, efficiency in reduction of carbon emissions, and effective resource management. <strong>There are four strategic directions in the plan:</strong>The increase in frequency and intensity of climate-related natural disasters such as flash floods, droughts, and landslides will carry a huge impact if they occur in high-density areas such as Kuala Lumpur. This is even more vital as Kuala Lumpur is the hub of the nation’s growth with a large population. Therefore, efforts towards enhancing resilience against climate change and natural disasters are important in the coming years. This strategy aims to execute a planning and development strategy that increases the city’s resilience against climate change and natural disasters. This strategic push also focuses on the development of resource-efficient infrastructure to improve resource management (relating to water supply), sewerage systems, solid waste, and electricity in ways that are efficient, reliable and sustainable. <strong>This strategy has three (3) objectives: </strong>A low carbon society plays an important role in forming a low carbon and green city. A low carbon society’s lifestyle refers to low carbon habits that relate to the way of life at the local and community level. In order to achieve this, it is crucial to empower society to conduct such initiatives through an action plan.

Urban Micro-Lungs Initiative in Amman
#################################################################################

            May 2021        The Urban Micro-Lungs (UML) initiative is a green infrastructure intervention executed by the project Improving Living Conditions in disadvantaged areas in Amman (ILCA), funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic development and Cooperation (BMZ) and implemented by GIZ in partnership with the Jordanian Ministry of Environment and Greater Amman Municipality. The initiative is implemented with the technical expertise of Tayyun Research Studio and aims at establishing two urban micro-forests in the densely populated area of East Amman. Urban expansion and densification have led to widespread habitat loss. Native trees and plants which normally grow in these regions have been replaced by buildings and paved areas. The UML initiative aims to bring back nature into the city through a unique planting technique called the Miyawaki Method. This method utilises meticulous soil engineering to provide the ideal conditions for plant growth. Plants and trees are carefully selected, based on the habitat present in the region, and layered to create a self-sustaining native forest that develops up to ten times faster than conventional methods. Greening dense urban areas with these self-sustaining forests can help offset some of the negative effects of climate change. Indeed, residents of the implementation areas mentioned an increase in extreme weather events such as flash floods and heatwaves over the past years as a directly observable effect of environmental degradation- linked to climate change. In addition, dense urban areas tend to have lower air quality due to mounting traffic congestion and decreased green cover. These micro-forests provide various environmental benefits by improving air quality, providing shade, and reducing water runoff. The careful selection of plant species, based on the habitat of the area, also ensures that they are drought tolerant and require little maintenance. The UML initiative generates awareness among both the population and local authorities on the importance of green infrastructure. It also provides the municipality of Amman with a replicable model to develop urban green spaces adapted to the ecological context of the country. The surrounding community will be able to enjoy the improved aesthetics and witness the positive health outcomes resulting from the newly established forests. The project utilised a participatory approach involving community members of all ages in the transformation process of the selected areas. In addition, the process itself was the occasion to raise awareness of the environmental benefits of native plants and better care of public spaces. The changes didn’t stop there: further beautification of one of the planting locations was also undertaken and completed with the neighbouring community to increase ownership and make the site a place that residents are proud of.

Clean Cities Through Better Waste Management Systems
#################################################################################

            January 2021        The waste management sector is Jordan’s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, with the most notable of those being methane. These gases are mainly produced by organic waste that is not properly pre-treated.The Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) metropolitan area is home to 4 million of the country’s 9.5 million inhabitants. With a rapidly growing population, more waste is being produced. Waste management systems in the country, especially in the capital, are overburdened. Waste collected in Amman was being disposed of at the Al Ghabawi landfill without any treatment. Less than three percent of recyclable materials were recovered by the informal economy. The waste management staff lack practical expertise and resources to modernise the waste sector and mitigate harmful effects on the climate. In order to remedy these issues, recyclables need to first be separated and then treated in a separate process.The waste management project implemented by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) is intended to support the Jordanian administration to lay the foundations for a climate-friendly waste cycle management program in the Greater Amman Municipality (GAM). Alternatives to using landfills will be created and emissions of greenhouse gases will be reduced. Recyclables will be collected separately and then utilised accordingly.In the pilot projects, various models for separate collection and recycling are being developed and tested in cooperation with the communities in three selected neighbourhoods. The models follow the National Solid Waste Management Strategy and Amman Strategic Waste Plan. They are adapted to different local and cultural conditions. The collected recyclables are treated and recycled in appropriate facilities. Training measures help qualify employees to plan and optimise routes and to collect and evaluate data. Employees also learn how to communicate with the producers of garbage regarding waste avoidance and separation of recyclables. Those responsible for the pilot composting and sorting systems not only receive operation and maintenance training, but they also learn how mass balances are prepared and costs are calculated. Sharing experiences at the local, national, regional and international levels is encouraged. Courses and conferences deepen knowledge and facilitate exchange, as does participation in specialised platforms, such as the “Connective Cities: Municipal know-how for host communities in the Middle East” platform.Three differently structured pilot regions, two residential areas and one business district were selected for the pilot introduction of the separate collection of recyclable materials. For the first pilot region, a working group consisting of community members of the residential area, representatives of the GAM, and national and international GIZ consultants was established. The evaluation of the current situation, including household surveys, was completed for the first pilot region in November 2018. Based on these results, a decision was made together with GAM to determine which collection systems would be tested for the separate collection of recyclable materials. In the first pilot area, around 3,100 households participated in the separate collection of waste and recyclables. As a result, around 1.6 tonnes of recyclable materials are recovered daily and will not end up in landfill.

Kolkata Launches India’s First Electric Tram Library for Adults and Young Readers
#################################################################################

            January 2021        To increase the appeal of using electrified trams as the choice mode of transport among students in Kolkata, the city is introducing India’s first tram library in College Street. To further increase the appeal of tram ridership to a wider demographic, Kolkata has also launched library tramcars catered towards younger children and has converted some trams into mobile art galleries.It is the first tram library in India. Kolkata has been the first city in India to establish many innovations. To add to their list of feats, the city is now the first to introduce a tram library in the iconic area of College Street. It is said that if a book doesn’t exist in College Street, it was never published.  College Street is the academic district of Kolkata. The area around the street is home to the most iconic educational institutions. The Wi-Fi-enabled tram library was launched with the aim to attract more students into using trams as their default mode of transport, provide access to educational material, and to reinvigorate the love for reading.Since COVID-19, which led to the suspension of tram services, and Cyclone Amphan in May, which grounded the trams, four out of six tram routes have resumed services. The tram library was launched on 24 September 2020, when the iconic Shyambazar-Esplanade route that passes by the academic institutions resumed. The route coincides with 30 educational institutions on College Street. “The idea is to catapult the tram as the chosen mode for Kolkata students again,” said Rajanvir Singh Kapur, Managing Director of WBTC. Introduced by the West Bengal Transport Corporation (WBTC), the corporation that oversees India’s only functional tramways, the Tram Library is a special tram with a section for books, magazines, and various exam material. The books are updated regularly. The tram also has free Wi-Fi, allowing passengers to access e-books on top of the books in the library. With access to both physical and e-books, youth can spend their travel time productively. There are plans to host literature festivals and book launches in the tram libraries in the future, which will increase the appeal of using the trams as their preferred transport. As a part of the campaign to celebrate the inauguration of the Tram Library, free pens were also given on all ticket purchases in the first week. Prior to the launch, WBTC installed art in some trams which depict how the trams began in 1873 and got electrified in 1900. Since 1902, the electric tramcars have operated in Kolkata and they are the oldest running electric tram system in Asia. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, trams and depots will be properly and regularly disinfected and sanitised to maintain the safety of passengers.To increase the appeal of the ridership to younger children and encourage reading amongst them, Kolkata also launched the world’s first Library on Tram dedicated to children on the 14th November 2020. Dubbed the Kolkata Young Readers’ Tramcar, the project is an initiative by the West Bengal Transport Corporation (WBTC) and Apeejay Anand Children’s Library that aims to give children across all age groups access to books and to encourage reading amongst the younger children while traveling.  To ensure suitable content for children, the WBTC collaborated with Oxford Bookstores to curate a unique selection of titles and literature for various children age groups for the Kolkata Young Readers’ Tram Car. The tram libraries are also decorated with artwork of children hand-painted by local artists, adding to the charm of the city’s tram transport. The Kolkata Young Readers’ Tram Car was launched virtually by Mr. Rajanvir Singh Kapur, MD, West Bengal Transport Corporation, and Ms. Priti Paul, Director Apeejay Surrendra Group. Celebrating the artistic spirit of the city, WBTC has launched a Tram Art Gallery in the first week of December, displaying art from many iconic artists from Bengal. The Tram Art Gallery has been modified such that the interiors are modelled to easily display easels and paintings.On days when the tram is booked by artists, people can enjoy the paintings as the tram runs along its route. On days when there are no bookings, WBTC will be displaying a collection of old archival tram photos and works of trams so that the tram continues to run daily. The aim of the Tram Art Gallery is to make art exhibitions accessible to all, especially to students. Artists who book the trams to display their work are charged per day, but there are concessions of up to 50% if the artists are students or from charitable organisations. This aims to promote the appeal of trams and art to the youth. The tram system in Kolkata runs on Shyambazar Esplanade and Esplanade Gariahat routes spanning from North to South of Kolkata. The Kolkata tramways have been in operation since 1873 and the WBTC has recently made multiple efforts to increase the appeal of electric trams to make it a choice mode of transport in Kolkata. Increasing the ridership of electric trams instead of private transport will reduce the number of vehicles on the road, and in turn, contribute to reducing emissions from private transport. There are plans to host more literary events in the trams in the future. There are plans to conduct activities such as storytelling, dramatised readings, poetry sessions, book launches, and music. These activities conducted throughout the year aim to increase the appeal of travelling by trams as opposed to using private transport.

Waste to Art: India’s first tyre park in Kolkata
#################################################################################

            January 2021        With the aim to turn waste into art, the West Bengal Transport Corporation (WBTC) has planned to launch India’s first Tyre Park in Kolkata. Discarded tyres and scraps are usually piled up at Kolkata bus depots, and due to the lack of proper disposal and exposure to rain, these waste piles can become a health hazard. To manage this, the in-house WBTC team has collected the discarded items and have reworked and converted the waste into swings, chairs, tables and other colourful, eye-catching art to be featured in the park. The tyres have also been painted with some of the city’s symbolic structures and transport systems to increase the appeal of the park to the public. The Tyre Park will be located at the esplanade in the city and will cater to the public with the addition of a café, music, and a space to relax amidst the hustle of the busy city. The introduction of Tyre Park makes a case for a circular economy through a ‘Recycling & Reuse of Waste’ approach. Initially, WBTC would give these tyres away for disposal and partially sell them to scrap dealers for a paltry sum. Given this new approach, WBTC is also able to generate revenue by charging a small entrance fee to the facility which was established by WBTC employees. Tyre Park will have a small café, music, and it will be a little space for people to sit, relax and enjoy the various craftsmanship made by only tyres. From the esplanade, the people can also ride on the Tram Library that runs on Esplanade Shyam-Bazar route. Also, they can see Smarnika nearby, which has some old tram archives.

Chennai's Pondy Bazaar Pedestrian Plaza
#################################################################################

            January 2021        The Special Projects Department, GCC and Chennai Smart City Limited has established a Pedestrian Plaza at Theyagaraya Nagar (T Nagar) with the aim of utilising additional road space to incorporate all essential pedestrian amenities and to create a traffic-free social space for the citizens of Chennai. People, particularly senior citizens, persons with disabilities, children and women, finally have a place to walk, shop, eat and lounge freely. The pedestrianisation of roads has acted as a catalyst for economic growth, attracting many tourists and locals alike.The Pedestrian Plaza was envisioned to transform 1.4 km of prime commercial space in the heart of the Area-Based Development (ABD) region of T Nagar. The road selected was Sir Theyagaraya Road, stretching from Panagal Park to Mount Road, covering several retail outlets, malls and office buildings. The first 800 m of the road, popularly known as Pondy Bazaar, is always seen bustling with shoppers and tourists.The objective of the project was to provide all necessary amenities for pedestrians, including seating clusters, sheltered bus-stops, motor-free walkways, toilets, covered dustbins, inclusive play space and so on by converting additional road space into broadened walkways.In a traffic study conducted in 2016, it was noted that nearly 5,000 people walk through Pondy Bazaar during peak hours in a day. The 1.4 km stretch, though crowded with retailers and shoppers, lacked basic safety and convenience for pedestrians. There were several issues of broken footpaths, intruding greenery, encroachments by vehicles parked in a haphazard manner, utilities blocking the movement of shoppers, broad carriageways narrow walkways, exposed crossings, and no spots for public convenience.All the above reasons implied that the central commercial zone was a traffic hazard for common people. Moreover, it became a hotspot for petty crimes such as pickpocketing and also an opportunity for anti-social activities such as molesting and harassment. It was vital to make the experience for the pedestrians a safe, inclusive, happy and vibrant one.Other case studies from places such as Times Square in New York and La Rambla in Barcelona showed that busy commercial zones are best experienced by foot. The transformation of the walkways into public recreational space also added to the revenue of those regions. The Pedestrian Plaza was thus conceived with the intent of enhancing the unique shopping experience by reclaiming the public space for shoppers.Some of the key design elements of the Pedestrian Plaza is given below:The implementation of Pedestrian Plaza at Sir Theyagraya Road was done across three stretches. The first stretch is 730m from Panagal Park to Thanikachalam Road junction. The second stretch is 380m from Thanikachalam Road junction to Boag Road junction. The third stretch is 450m from Boag Road junction to Mount Road. The project was initiated on 7th May 2018 and was implemented by the Special Projects Department of Greater Chennai Corporation with funding from Chennai Smart City Limited. The project was executed at an overall cost of Rs. 39.86 crores. It was inaugurated on 13th November 2019 by Hon’ble Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Thiru Edapadi K Palanisami amidst much fanfare and celebrations.The Pedestrian Plaza is a first-of-its-kind pedestrian-friendly commercial zone in Chennai. Apart from the above features, the whole process adopted towards the Pedestrian Plaza was through a participatory approach.One common myth across the world is that retail activity is largely dependent on the usage of private motor vehicles – more cars, bigger profits. However, contrary to this popular belief, shopping districts flourish even without the presence of cars – indicated by our very own Ranganathan and Triplicane Streets.The Traders Association of Pondy Bazaar was initially not convinced with the proposal for the Pedestrian Plaza, claiming that their livelihood could be affected if cars were not allowed to enter Pondy Bazaar. Following this test run, the design was refined further, and a stakeholder discussion was organised where the proposal was explained to the shopkeepers. Cases from around the world were also presented including Times Square. It was decided that a second trial run would be conducted on 25 February 2017 to demonstrate how the public enjoys vibrant spaces and how such a project would invite more people to come to visit. Surveys during the trial run indicated that the visitors were thrilled with the changes. This helped appease the shopkeepers, who have since been involved in multiple discussions with the engineers and architects.The project aims at transforming the street to encourage more people to walk, shop and wander without the fear of accidents. It will enhance pedestrian and cyclist safety, foster community interaction, and boost local businesses. By transforming the shopping street from a car-centric to a people-centric space, the pedestrian plaza will result in better air quality, health, and wellbeing of the users.Fear and anxiety surrounding parking, as well as if it will impact the footfall to the area, are common across pedestrian plaza projects throughout the world. However, it is important to note, that so far, none of these businesses have been found to bleed revenue due to limited vehicle space.Some of the visible benefits/ positive impacts observed in the few months after the inauguration were:Pedestrianisation projects have great scope to be replicated across various locations in the city. After the initial success of the Pedestrian Plaza project, similar designs are being considered for locations such as Khader Nawaz Khan Road and sections of heritage locations Mylapore, Triplicane, and George Town.Additionally, Chennai Smart City and Special Projects Department have taken up the ambitious project of Safe Streets in Public Spaces/Mega Streets Project which aims to transform nearly 100km of city’s roads to include footpaths, play-space, traffic islands and safe crossways.

Inclusive & Sensory Public Space in Chennai
#################################################################################

            January 2021        The park department of Greater Chennai Corporation has established a model Sensory Park at Santhome on the land belonging to Greater Chennai Corporation. This park was built under the Chennai Smart City Project, measuring around 1,500 square meters. It is a way forward with inclusive governance and recreational infrastructure for the citizens of Chennai. The park excels with innovative standards. The design and layout of the park provide a stimulating journey through the senses and heighten awareness that brings positive learning experiences.A sensory park, as the name implies, focuses on features that attract multiple senses of an individual. These are specialised parks for all visitors with a special emphasis on children with disabilities. The purpose of such an initiative is to provide individual and combined sensory opportunities to users who may not have had such an experience thus far.A sensory garden, for example, contains features that are accessible to differently-abled individuals. These features include scented and edible plants, tactile sculptures, sculpted handrails, water features designed to make sound and wash over the hands, textured touch-pads, magnifying-glass screens, Braille signage, and audio induction loop descriptions. Depending on the user group, other provisions may further integrate sound and music, more centrally to combine the needs of younger users with their respective sensory access.Some of the features of Sensory Park include:

Smart LED Street Lighting in Chennai
#################################################################################

            January 2021        Rapid urbanisation encourages proportionate enhancements to be made in the appropriate urban public utility infrastructures. Such public utilities are energised majorly by non-renewable sources; therefore, it is critical to conserve energy & enhance the quality of life for the people in Chennai City. Streetlights, as one of the major consumers of energy in the public utility infrastructure segment, was evaluated for optimisation. <strong>The roadmap has 3 stages:</strong><strong>Stage 1: </strong>As a part of Stage 1, 70% of streetlights in the city have been changed to a LED-based lighting system which has resulted in savings of INR 68 crores. Area Based Development under the Chennai Smart City Initiative started Stage 2 by selecting a pilot location (T Nagar) in the city and it has been successfully commissioned. Currently, Stage 2 & 3 activities are planning to be started in the ABD area.The Greater Chennai Corporation maintains 2,77,902 streetlights and the total charges for its electricity consumption amounts to nearly Rs 4.64 crores a month. The street lamps were first introduced in 1785. Till 1857, there were only 200 oil light lamps. By the year 1910, there were 6,500 oil lights. Electric street lighting was introduced for the first time in 1910. The improvement of lighting on this account was so immense that the number of electric lights gradually increased till the years of 1924-25 when all the lights were completely replaced by electric lights.Ever since, a fair amount of the department’s expenditures have gone towards the maintenance of sodium-vapour lamps, which have a high burn-out rate. Given their high consumption of electricity and high maintenance cost, it was proposed to switch to LED lights for energy and cost savings.The work order for the project was commissioned on 4 October 2017 and the project was slated for completion on 5th January 2018. The project cost was estimated at Rs 3.44 crores. The project was completed by 2nd January 2018 at a cost of Rs 2.94 crores, and it was funded by the Smart City Mission.The Smart Street Lights have been installed as an open standard solution that is highly scalable and interoperable. The solution is designed for SCADA based monitoring with an automatic ticket-generation tool in case the light is not functioning. All of these technological features show that lights can be monitored even from remote locations and the functionality of the lights can be taken into account. This enables speedier replacement and low maintenance in case of repairs. The scalability factor ensures that the entire region can shift to a plan of energy efficiency and that it is easily replicable irrespective of the topography or demographic pattern of the region.The project was initiated for the ABD area of T Nagar. In this project, 1,772 lights were changed from sodium-vapour lamps to LED lights. Spanning 6.92 sq. km., T Nagar is already an established development in the CBD region of Chennai.On average, nearly 2 lakh pedestrians use the streets of T Nagar and on a festive day the market area alone witnesses up to 20 lakh persons. Hence, good lighting adds to better security and mobility in the region.Smart Street Lighting has the following innovative characteristics:Apart from the reduction in the carbon footprint, the savings in energy consumption and cost to government is given below:Since the spread of the LED light is over a larger radius than the conventional sodium-vapour lamps, the number of dark pockets in the region has been considerably reduced. The better lighting also invites increased footfall in the commercial areas.Some of the expected impacts include:1)    Reduction in crime rates in the regionThe project is highly scalable and has already been rolled out for 70% of the city’s street lights, apart from the ABD area of T Nagar. The remaining 30% is in the rollout phase and is to be completed in the coming months.The smart streetlights are designed with SCADA system that would enable them to be monitored from the Command & Control Centre. The performance of these lights can be directly correlated to the trends in crime rates, mobility, economic activity, and productivity of the region. Thereby, the data collated from the various projects in the Smart City Mission can be collaboratively analyzed to evaluate the performance of these lights and their impact on the livability of the city.

Eco buses in Venice Lido and Pellestrina Islands
#################################################################################

            January 2021        The Venice Lido and Pellestrina Island transport system will be fully electric by 2021. 30 eco buses will replace the diesel ones thanks to the European Investment Bank, Ministry of Infrastructure and city funds.Since 2018, the City of Venice has launched a program to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions produced by public transport. With the help of planned interventions from AVM S.p.A. and ACTV S.p.A. (the local in-house public transport companies), the city can introduce electric “eco-buses” on the islands of Venice Lido and Pellestrina. This will help fill the need to replace traditional diesel vehicles.The project involves the purchase of 30 electric buses and the setup of 15 charging points (9 fast, 6 slow + 4 transformer cabs). The recharge will guarantee a travel limit compatible with the transport needs of the islands (70 km/day).Thanks to this program, it will be possible to reduce the annual emissions of COThese innovative and smart buses have 88 max capacity, 27 seats and 2 for people with disabilities, USB ports, free-on-board WIFI service, info monitor and audio-video circuits to follow the route stop by stop through audio messages and graphic images.The city will invest a total of about 28 million euros for the described modern and eco-sustainable transport system. They will receive loan benefits from the European Fund for Strategic Investments, the European Investment Bank, the Ministry of Transport, and other local funders. The “green” turning point of Lido and Pellestrina is strengthened, both for the quality of liveability and for the environmental sustainability of the two islands as a tourist destination.Due to the COVID -19 emergency/lockdown, the project upgrade has slowed down, but hopefully, it will be completed by 2021.The eco-buses are equipped with battery packs with a distance of 70 km/day, guaranteed for 7 years and 15,000 charging cycles.In the next years, the city will renovate the whole transport fleet. Today the Actv fleet counts on 59 new last generation buses. By the beginning of 2022, 75% of users will travel on new buses. By 2023, there will be around 200 new vehicles. Moreover, the installation of 50 charging stations for private cars is also essential.

La Experiencia de los Laboratorios Urbanos en Quito como Herramienta para Reducir los Efectos del Cambio Climático y Mejorar el Hábitat
#################################################################################

            January 2021        En la actualidad, Latino América está atravesando por problemas en la estructura de sus ciudades, en el caso del Distrito Metropolitano de Quito, se han identificado problemáticas presentes en varios ejes, como los siguientes:  la degradación del espacio público y la fragmentación de los ecosistemas naturales, la dispersión y crecimiento incontrolado de la mancha urbana, la degradación de los recursos naturales y vulnerabilidad frente al cambio climático, el modelo de movilidad pública insostenible el cual incentiva el uso del vehículo privado e incrementa las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero.Adicionalmente, debido a la crisis sanitaria por la COVID-19, mencionadas problemáticas de la ciudad se han intensificado generando inseguridad, crisis económicas y aislamiento social que ha reducido la participación ciudadana.Por lo tanto, desde la Secretaría de Territorio, Hábitat y Vivienda del Municipio del Distrito Metropolitano de Quito se crea el programa de implementación de los “Laboratorios Urbanos” en colaboración con entidades públicas, privadas, la comunidad y la academia para promover espacio de intercambio de ideas, experiencias y debate sobre la mejora de la calidad del hábitat, reducción de los efectos del cambio climático, a través de acciones experimentales y temporales en el espacio público por medio de estrategias de bajo costo, rápida implementación y gran impacto como el urbanismo táctico. Convirtiéndose, los Laboratorios urbanos, en espacios de investigación y generación de información en el territorio para identificar, evaluar y escalar programas y políticas públicas relacionadas al hábitat, espacio público, cambio climático, bajo conceptos de sostenibilidad, inclusión, calidad, universalidad, generando ciudades equitativas, seguras, resilientes y amigables con el medio ambiente.El programa de Laboratorios Urbanos se implementa a través de las siguientes fases: Estas fases permiten observar a la ciudad como un “ecosistema urbano” para generar cambios desde lo interno de la ciudad y abarcar un concepto más amplio de sostenibilidad incluyendo diferentes componentes urbanos que trascienden lo ambiental e incluye variables culturales, políticas, institucionales, sociales y económicas.Actualmente, se encuentran en desarrollo laboratorios urbanos en el Sur, en el centro Norte y en los valles del Distrito Metropolitano de Quito.En los cuales se están generando alternativas sustentables en: micro movilidad sostenible y no contaminante, incremento de zonas verdes y arbolado urbano, espacios públicos pensados para el uso cotidiano de la ciudad, reducción de islas de calor, entre otras;Laboratorio Urbano de Iñaquito<strong>Antes</strong><strong>Después </strong>Para el desarrollo de este laboratorio se realizaron encuestas perceptivas a la comunidad en cuanto a seguridad, medio ambiente, movilidad, inclusión, infraestructura y mobiliario urbano, la misma evidenció la falta de vegetación y como esto ha generado inundaciones e islas de calor en el sector. Por otro lado, se evaluaron criterios de accesibilidad universal donde se mostró que no se están cumpliendo con los mismos ya que no existen franjas de circulación guía de tipo podotáctil, estacionamientos para personas vulnerables. Mediante la colaboración de colectivos, estudiantes universitarios y la Secretaría de Territorio, Hábitat y Vivienda, fue posible recabar gran cantidad de información sobre los diferentes actores, comercios y servicios existentes dentro del polígono del Laboratorio Urbano de Iñaquito; la STHV, elaboró un aplicativo que permitió ejecutar dicho levantamiento, lo cual permitió a los vecinos conocer mejor su barrio, y que crezca el sentido de pertenencia del sector. Se logró realizar el cierre del tránsito vehicular en el corazón de la supermanzana para priorizar al peatón y dejar un espacio público seguro de estancia para el disfrute de niños, adultos mayores y de los vecinos del sector. Como parte de la reactivación económica de este laboratorio se estableció un espacio denominado “mercadito del barrio”, el mismo que apoya la producción local, la economía campesina y el consumo responsable, en donde se invitó a participar a agricultores urbanos quienes presentaron sus productos agroecológicos y brindaron su servicio a los vecinos de Iñaquito.Durante el Laboratorio Urbano se realizaron actividades que promueven una vida más saludable, calles más amigables con el ambiente y espacios públicos más dinámicos y seguros, llenos de expresiones culturales y recreativas. Como parte de este proceso se implementó de forma temporal arbolado urbano, el ciclo paseo barrial Iñakitu de la Quebrada, actividades lúdicas de diseño participativo y se firmaron acuerdos y convenios para la siembra de árboles en Iñaquito.Laboratorio Urbano de Cumbayá<strong>Antes</strong><strong>Propuesta </strong><strong>Ahora </strong>Para el desarrollo de este Laboratorio se aplicaron estrategias de levantamiento de datos en base a metodologías de medios mixtos, cualitativos y cuantitativos. Los resultados obtenidos en el ámbito económico fueron la generación de empleo, nuevos emprendimientos, beneficio a propietarios por alquiler de negocios, entre otros. En lo social se lograron nuevas dinámicas en el espacio público con áreas seguras para niños, para ciclistas y adultos mayores, también se recuperó la memoria histórica del barrio y se fortaleció el sentido de pertenencia de sus moradores. En cuanto a movilidad se garantizó la prioridad peatonal, se habilitó espacio para ciclistas y medios alternativos de micromovilidad y se disminuyó el espacio para vehículos privados; en el polígono de intervención se garantizó la accesibilidad universal y se implementaron medidas de pacificación vehicular. Se favoreció al sector ambientalmente al reducir la carga vehicular en el interior del polígono, al incrementar la presencia de vegetación urbana y al articularse con los recicladores base locales con el manejo adecuado de residuos orgánicos.Otro aspecto importante de la implementación del laboratorio urbano de Cumbayá fue la participación ciudadana, el involucramiento de la comunidad y que formen parte de las transformaciones del espacio público permitió que se generen espacio de cooperación entre sectores tradicionales y nuevas actividades económicas que se han ido generando en el sitio y así hacer un barrio más seguro, con calles destinadas al ser humano, con la presencia de niños, jóvenes, madres, y personas de la tercera edad fortaleciendo el tejido social barrial. El laboratorio de Chimbacalle es un proyecto que tiene como alcance trabajar en la seguridad con un enfoque cultural en el entorno patrimonial del barrio. Tomando como base proyectos turísticos – culturales que la propia comunidad ha ido generando durante varios años.El objetivo es empoderar a la comunidad sobre sus procesos históricos y culturales fortaleciendo el turismo comunitario y apropiándose del espacio público con la implementación de urbanismo táctico e implementación de murales. Para el desarrollo y la implementación de este laboratorio se contó con el apoyo de la comunidad, de colectivos culturales del territorio, de la academia y de varias instituciones públicas que en conjunto participaron para sacar adelante un proyecto que tiene como fin mejorar la calidad de vida de los ciudadanos. Una de las transformaciones más importantes fue el cambio del estado actual de los pasajes y calles donde han sucedido actos de delincuencia que han afectado gravemente al sector. Estos pasajes se pudieron iluminar, trabajar con la comunidad para que las fachadas sean amigables al estar en entorno escolar y también que los vecinos formen parte del cambio se apropien de su sector. Finalmente, los laboratorios urbanos han sido una muestra del repensar, resignificar, reconstruir y planificar la ciudad para lograr la anhelada sostenibilidad urbana, desde un enfoque de diversidad de sus territorios, generando cambios de ideología, educación, fortaleciendo capacidades institucionales y comunitarias con la finalidad de que la localidad se apropie de sus territorios, y se fomente autogestión de su propio hábitat; creando políticas públicas de hábitat y desarrollo sostenible desde una realidad específica y particularmente territorial, que permita implantarse desde lo local hacia lo general.Siendo así, los laboratorios urbanos buscan crear ciudades habitables que tengan como protagonista los peatones, adecuando sus recorridos a su escala, incentivando las actividades comerciales integradamente, dentro de una red de espacios libres y zonas verdes en cantidad y calidad adecuada. Permitiendo reducir la emisión de gases de efecto invernadero para mejorar la calidad ambiental y la calidad de vida de los habitantes. Haciendo de Quito, una ciudad sana, sin contaminación ni ruidos, una ciudad segura y amigable  <strong>SECRETARÍA DE TERRITORIO, HÁBITAT Y VIVIENDA<br/>MUNICIPIO DEL DISTRITO METROPOLITANO DE QUITO</strong>

Ciclovías en la capital
#################################################################################

            January 2021        Quito, a sus 2.835 metros sobre el nivel del mar, con una topografía compleja, con una pared montañosa al occidente, varias quebradas que la atraviesan de forma transversal y dos valles altamente poblados hacia el oriente, sumados unos grados de dificultad al planificar infraestructura ciclista, con 540 mil vehículos motorizados en vías estrechas; y  una contribución del sector transporte con más de tres millones de toneladas de dióxido de carbono equivalente, que corresponde al 52% de las emisiones de huella de carbono a nivel urbano, presenta un gran un desafío para la planificación de la movilidad, y más aún con los problemas generados por la emergencia sanitaria.Por otro lado, hay una parte ciudadana también compleja que se ha venido trabajando y que debe ser mucho más profundizada, que es la visión que los ciudadanos tienen al respecto de la bicicleta y otros modos de transporte distintos al automóvil. Desde un aspiracional inalcanzable hasta una necesidad indiscutible, las versiones de por qué es necesaria la adquisición de un vehículo propio son variadas en Quito. Pero las propuestas que la ciudad presente como alternativas a esta aspiración deben ser contundentes, claras, bien implementadas y logradas a un nivel en el que esa misma visión se vaya reemplazando por una con mayores ventajas a futuro. Esos son los fuertes obstáculos que hemos tenido que sortear como ciudad para la implementación de un importante proyecto de ciclovías urbanas con un concepto de movilidad accesible, sostenible, conectivo, seguro y eficiente que no se había planteado antes en la ciudad.Si bien es cierto, Quito contaba ya con casi 58km de ciclovías (entre bidireccionales, unidireccionales, compartidas y sub urbanas), implementadas en los últimos 12 años, no se había planteado un reemplazo modal impactante hasta el momento, a través de la toma de un carril vehicular completo por sentido en avenidas colectoras principales en la urbe. Cosa que no ha sido fácil y que ha causado algo de conmoción en los conductores de vehículos particulares principalmente, quienes ven que las vías están “repletas” de autos y la congestión es un acompañante intenso en los desplazamientos de los quiteños. Este proyecto de 67.5km de ciclovías amplias, conectivas, visibles e implementadas en vías principales a lo largo y ancho de la ciudad empezó a ejecutarse en junio del año de la pandemia. Aprovechando la oportunidad que las calles algo desoladas nos permitió, para que las obras sean lo menos disruptivas posible. <img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyMjYgMzc4IiB3aWR0aD0iMjI2IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjM3OCIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyNzMwXzEub3JpZ2luYWwuanBnJTNGMTYwODEzOTA3NCIgZGF0YS13PSIyMjYiIGRhdGEtaD0iMzc4IiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4="><img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzOTAgMzc4IiB3aWR0aD0iMzkwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjM3OCIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyNzMxXzIub3JpZ2luYWwuanBnJTNGMTYwODEzOTA5MiIgZGF0YS13PSIzOTAiIGRhdGEtaD0iMzc4IiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4="/></img>Pero el proyecto no viene sólo, es parte de una planificación amplia en cuanto a la compleja movilidad de la ciudad, que tiene varias aristas importantes y nunca antes intervenidas. Entre las que está una mejora integral a los sistemas de transporte público, una restricción vehicular potente, la reestructuración de los perfiles viales para darle priorización al peatón y al ciclista y la implementación del Metro. Todos proyectos enlazados entre sí y profundamente conectados con una visión de ciudad más sostenible, amigable y accesible.Todo el plan tiene como objetivo la cobertura longitudinal de la principal mancha urbana, desde la micro-centralidad de Calderón-Carapungo al norte de Quito hasta la zona de Quitumbe al extremo sur, y cerca de 20 corredores transversales que funcionen como alimentadores desde los barrios orientales y occidentales hacia el ramal longitudinal principal, más o menos en la manera en que los flujos de agua solían moverse en el terreno antes del crecimiento arquitectónico de la ciudad.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA3NDggNTM2IiB3aWR0aD0iNzQ4IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjUzNiIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyNzMyXzMub3JpZ2luYWwuanBnJTNGMTYwODEzOTEwMyIgZGF0YS13PSI3NDgiIGRhdGEtaD0iNTM2IiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4="/>Desde junio hasta diciembre se ha ejecutado casi el 25% del proyecto con un presupuesto e inventario limitados.

Y será solamente un peldaño en una escalera de infraestructura que debe continuar sin importar quién esté a la cabeza de la ciudad ni qué visión tenga, ya que la movilidad sostenible es un concepto que se debe conservar sin importar cualquier otra circunstancia.

Zero Emission Tokyo Strategy
#################################################################################

            December 2020        The The Zero Emission Tokyo Strategy comprehensively develops mitigation measures to reduce CO2 emissions and adaptation measures to avoid and reduce impacts from climate change. It also incorporates sustainable resource management into policies that contribute to reducing emissions even outside the city, and it aims to strengthen efforts in all fields. Taking Tokyo’s characteristics into account, the plan highlights six key sectors with 14 policies that are crucial to Tokyo achieving net zero emissions. The six key sectors include: energy, urban infrastructure for buildings, urban infrastructure for transport, resource/industrial sector, climate change adaptation and engagement & inclusion. Out of the 14 policies formulated, promoting Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs), strengthening adaptation measures and reducing plastic waste have been identified as the highest priorities. Tokyo has further developed individual plans and strategies with detailed initiatives for these three high priority policies.To realise these policy visions for 2050, the city has defined 17 major targets to be achieved by 2030, which include 47 items and 82 actions. The policies and key targets are:<strong><span class="tadv-background-color" style="background-color:#ffdc1a">Policy 1: Make Renewable Energy a Major Energy Source</span></strong>Key targets for 2030:Vision for 2050:<strong><span class="tadv-background-color" style="background-color:#ffdc1a">Policy 2: Expand the Use of Hydrogen Energy</span></strong>Key targets for 2030:Vision for 2050:<strong><span class="tadv-background-color" style="background-color:#ffdc1a">Policy 3: Expansion of Zero Emission Buildings</span></strong>Key targets for 2030:Vision for 2050:<strong><span class="tadv-background-color" style="background-color:#ffdc1a">Policy 4: Promote the Spread of Zero-Emission Vehicles (ZEVs)*</span></strong>Key targets for 2030:Vision for 2050:<strong><span class="tadv-background-color" style="background-color:#ffdc1a">Policy 5: 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle)</span></strong>Key targets for 2030:Vision for 2050:<strong><span class="tadv-background-color" style="background-color:#ffdc1a">Policy 6: Plastics*</span></strong>Key targets for 2030:Vision for 2050:<strong><span class="tadv-background-color" style="background-color:#ffdc1a">Policy 7: Food Waste</span></strong>Key targets for 2030:Vision for 2050:<strong><span class="tadv-background-color" style="background-color:#ffdc1a">Policy 8: Fluorocarbons</span></strong>Key targets for 2030:Vision for 2050:<strong><span class="tadv-background-color" style="background-color:#ffdc1a">Policy 9: Strengthen Adaptation Measures*</span></strong>Key targets for 2030:Vision for 2050:<strong><span class="tadv-background-color" style="background-color:#ffdc1a">Policy 10: Cooperate With Various Actors in Movements and Reform of Social Systems</span></strong>Actions:<strong><span class="tadv-background-color" style="background-color:#ffdc1a">Policy 11: Strengthen Cooperation With Local Municipalities</span></strong>Actions:<strong><span class="tadv-background-color" style="background-color:#ffdc1a">Policy 12: TMG’s Initiatives For Its Own Sustainability</span></strong>Actions:<strong><span class="tadv-background-color" style="background-color:#ffdc1a">Policy 13: Strengthen Cooperation with Cities and Non-State Actors around the World</span></strong>Actions:<strong><span class="tadv-background-color" style="background-color:#ffdc1a">Policy 14: Promote Sustainable Finance</span></strong>Actions:*High priority sectorsFor high priority sectors, Tokyo has formulated individual plans and strategies with detailed initiatives. This strategy is the starting point for decarbonising Tokyo by helping to clarify its vision, specific efforts, and a roadmap to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. With an eye on anticipated major reforms, Tokyo has to aggressively and continuously contribute to decarbonisation as one of the world’s largest cities. Setting these visions as a baseline, Tokyo plans to continue to account for scientific knowledge, progress of initiatives and trends in technological development and listening to the voices of Tokyo’s residents and businesses. This is all to ensure that the upgrading of the goals and initiatives will be examined from many angles and the strategy will be updated in a timely manner to be in line with any possible changes in the city and social structure.

Tackling Air Pollution in Bangkok
#################################################################################

            December 2020        Air quality in Bangkok has gradually improved and for the most part, the number of air pollutants meet the Thailand ambient air quality standard. This success can be attributed to the combined effort of all sectors and stakeholders. Various government, private, academic and public sectors cooperated to continually mitigate air pollution. In particular, they worked to solve problems at the source by raising the standard of pollution emissions from automobiles and the quality of fuel. However, at present, some areas in Bangkok are confronted with PM2.5 air pollution, with 60% of pollutants coming from diesel-engine automobiles, 35% from open burning, and 5% due to other causes. These sources of emissions present the main challenge that needs to be addressed. Additionally, the meteorological condition of still air and calm wind has trapped dust particles in the air. The situation may get more severe if there is a lack of efficient solution planning for the future. It is also necessary for stakeholders to cooperate in solving the problems. Therefore, the government has announced that the challenge of the PM2.5 air pollution phenomenon is on the national agenda and all stakeholders must proceed with effective action to improve air quality for Thai citizens and visitors. Recognising the importance of ameliorating PM2.5 air pollution, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA), has stipulated many policies to observe and monitor real time dust through PM2.5 measurement stations. The data is reported on The objective is to observe and monitor the situation, analyze data in the matter of commanding the operational units, integrate relevant agencies, circulate information on the PM2.5 situation, and provide guidelines on how to prevent and reduce health effects via social media channels.<strong>The Committee has overseen short term operations, including: </strong><strong>For the long term, the BMA has implemented the measures, namely:</strong>The objective is to monitor, report, and announce the situation on PM2.5 air pollution, as well as to unite efforts to solve the problem in a timely manner. In case of PM2.5 exceeding the Thailand ambient air quality standard, the Center will notify the district offices in the areas and relevant agencies to take action immediately. Its purpose is to control diesel-engine automobiles that emit black smoke exceeding the standard, burning in the open air, and construction activities that affect air pollution.  This is to ensure the relevant agencies or authorities can promptly take action. Some stakeholders include the Pollution Control Department, Department of Health, Department of Disease Control, Thai Meteorological Department, Department of Land Transport, Metropolitan Police Bureau, Traffic Police, the 1st Army Area, etc. These agencies have provided management guidelines for the governor to take action under the level-three situation of PM2.5 with the emphasis on solving the pollution at the original sources and lessening the impact on people’s health through the following measures:This action plan is initiated under the National Agenda Action Plan to eradicate PM2.5 between December-April, attempting to ensure the number of days of PM2.5 does not exceed the Thailand air quality standards during the critical period increasing by 5% per year. Each measure will be implemented based on the level of PM2.5 and the potential impact on people’s health.   PM2.5 is a result of the same greenhouse gas emitters that affect health and the environment. The BMA, consequently, has unified policies and measures for continuing to monitor and solve the PM2.5 problem and greenhouse gas emissions in terms of cost reduction and co-benefit, and lowering the impact on people’s health, especially vulnerable groups such as children, patients, and elders. The BMA undertakes many activities such as evaluating and prohibiting automobiles with black smoke, promoting public transport, maintaining automobile engines to mitigate air pollution emission and save energy, managing traffic congestion, upgrading the standards of emissions from automobiles and quality of fuel, controlling burning in the open air, and increasing green areas, etc. The BMA strives to emphasise measures to control PM2.5 and provides knowledge on the prevention of PM2.5. Also, the BMA improves the channels to distribute information on air quality to the citizens to help them understand issues with air quality, and to create a cooperative network. The BMA’s air quality report application, AirBKK, has been developed to display the air quality index and covers the areas without air quality monitoring stations. The results are shown in colours specified by air quality index of the Pollution Control Department. The application also provides guidelines and information on the prevention of PM2.5. Information to follow Air Quality Index (AQI) at the actual locations can be accessed in real-time by downloading the AirBKK application available for both Android and iOS operating systems. According to the cooperative network for solving the PM2.5 problem under the dust crisis circumstances (December – April), the amount of PM2.5 has been gradually decreasing. The annual average of PM2.5 in Bangkok area in the year 2018 was 27 µg/m3. This was reduced to 26 µg/m3 in 2019 (the Pollution Control Department, 2020). However, due to the annual average standard, the amount of PM2.5 should not exceed 25 µg/m3. This highlights the ongoing challenge for the BMA and stakeholders to meet the Thailand ambient air quality standard.

The Green Bangkok 2030 Project
#################################################################################

            December 2020        The Environment Department, Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) sees the opportunity to increase urban green spaces by developing the unused spaces scattered throughout Bangkok that belong to both government and private agencies. These spaces include vacant public spaces, areas under the expressways, space between buildings, footpaths, land alongside the canals, etc. The Green Bangkok 2030 Project was launched by the BMA to carry out a collaboration between public, private and civil sectors equipped with the capability and public mind to expand green spaces in Bangkok. To meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, the Royal Thai Government aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% – 25% by 2030 compared to business as usual (BAU). 2030 is also the year that the United Nations is requiring member nations to achieve their Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Green Bangkok 2030 Project corresponds with SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities, and SDG 13: Climate action (Protect the planet). On 15 December 2019, the BMA announced the Green Bangkok 2030 Project together with other stakeholders—PTT Public Company Limited, Thai Association of Landscape Architects, Big Trees Project, We! Park Project, and Thailand Urban Tree Network. Following the announcement, the steering committee began to implement and monitor the project. The committee comprises of the Governor of Bangkok as a chairman of adviser to the committee, the Permanent Secretary for the BMA as a committee chairperson, and government, private stakeholders, civil society and educational institutions as committee members.The main objective of the Green Bangkok 2030 Project is to increase sustainable, quality green spaces. There are 5 key success indicators:  The Green Bangkok 2030 Project has set 3 targets:There are 11 pilot projects in Phase 1 (2021-2022), including:Many small and large private enterprises are interested in offering their own lands to take part in the Green Bangkok 2030 Project and increase green spaces in their communities. Therefore, for phase 2, the project is currently undergoing a process of official acceptance of the lands. Upon acceptance, the BMA will develop the offered lands as public green spaces for the city in the future and focus on increasing the green area by providing and expanding the 5 new green areas in Bangkok.

100% Renewable Energy at Yokohama City Hall
#################################################################################

            December 2020        The City of Yokohama aims to have all energy consumed within city-owned facilities powered by renewable energy by 2050. As a first step towards this goal, 100% of the electric power used at the new Yokohama City Hall building in FY2020 will come from renewable sources.In May 2020, Yokohama City published the As part of this goal, the city has committed to ensuring all energy consumption within City Hall facilities will be powered by 100% renewable energy by 2050. This also includes government offices and ward offices to be sourced from only renewable energy. Following the end of the government’s Feed-in Tariff (FIT) scheme, the new Yokohama City Hall building in FY2020 will receive 100% of its electric power from renewable energy produced by incineration plants in Yokohama and the energy from solar power generation facilities found in homes in the city (post-FIT). This move is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5,800t-CO2 per year, which accounts for 80% of emissions in the entire new Yokohama City Hall building. Renewable energy generated by incineration plants in Yokohama is supplied to the new building using a self-consignment system. Further, other energy options employing a post FIT model for energy generation are used to supply the new building with energy from electric power retailers.The city is working toward the complete shift to renewable energy in the ward offices frequented by residents and businesses alike by FY2025. The city is also looking to further expand the use of renewable energy, such as shifting to renewable energy in facilities used by residents.

Revitalization of Salvador’s Botanical Garden
#################################################################################

            December 2020        The requalification of Salvador’s Botanical Garden, inaugurated on November 12th, is one of the actions of the Municipal Government that aim to contribute to climate change adaptation, mitigation, and address climate justice. It is in line with Salvador’s Climate Action Plan and Resilience Strategy to strengthen adaptation efforts against the effects of climate change. The Botanical Garden is located in São Marcos, a very dense, low-income neighbourhood with few green spaces. It is one of the few spots of conservation of the Atlantic Forest in the area. Its revitalization brought to the area a green, public leisure space. This is a space for environmental education, a breath of fresh air, and the preservation of the Atlantic Forest in the middle of the urban chaos.With priceless environmental value for the municipality, this space has about 61 thousand plant species in an area of 160 thousand square meters. The Botanical Garden of Salvador is one of the areas of the city that houses an ethnobotanical space dedicated to the protection and cultivation of species used in Afro-indigenous-Brazilian cults and endangered plants.The constant push of urbanization into the remaining green spaces of the city makes the requalification of the botanical garden even more important, as it contains species not only from the Atlantic Forest but also from the Cerrado and Caatinga biomes. According to the Secretary of Sustainability, Innovation, and Resilience of Salvador, João Resch, “This here I say is a living laboratory. This fragment of forest has been here since the beginning of our history, so it is only recovering that we can maintain and study it, especially as it receives many students to carry out research and hold masterclasses.”The revitalization work was carried out for a year and involved an investment of $9,6 million (US$ 1.893.491,13 dollars). The financing was made available through the Development Bank of Latin America (CAF), the Urban Requalification Program of Salvador (Proquali), and with resources from the Municipal Government.The investment allowed for the “seedling nursery” to gain a nature observation pavilion, a nursery for the creation of a museum, and a meliponary of bees of the Uruçu species, which have no sting and are on the red list of extinction. The surrounding area was landscaped with grass and vegetation native to the Atlantic Forest in more than 4000m², and the sidewalks were recovered and made walkable again.All this revitalization will attract visitors and tourists to the area to help increase local commerce and generate wealth for local communities. Therefore, the expected impact of the revitalization of the Botanical Garden is both social, economic, and environmental. This is due to it becoming an important area of study, maintenance, and conservation for the Atlantic Forest in Salvador. It is receiving a new look and becoming available to the public again.

Salvador’s “Lighting our Neighborhood” Program installs LED lamps to improve economy, efficiency and security
#################################################################################

            December 2020        Since 2019, Salvador has been replacing its street incandescent lights with LED lights as one of the initiatives within the “Lighting our Neighbourhood” Program. This initiative has reached 100 of Salvador’s 163 neighborhoods and 75,000 poles in Salvador will have LED lights by the end of 2020. The Public Lighting Office (DSIP), a department of the Municipal Public Order Secretariat of Salvador, leads the Program. This initiative has many advantages in terms of light and energy efficiency. It reduces consumption by 50%, improves quality and durability, and increases the sense of security in neighborhoods.Replacing lamps with LED lighting makes the public lighting system more efficient as they can reach 50 to 100 thousand hours of operation, while other types of lamps are only around 30 thousand hours. LED lighting has a luminous efficiency up to five times higher than incandescent lights. This makes maintenance costs much lower helping the Municipal Government decrease its energy consumption tariff. Simultaneously, as LED lights are more powerful at lighting the streets, they also help to reinforce public safety and improve pedestrian visibility at night. In addition, LED luminaires are easy to control via a remote management system, reducing operating costs and avoiding CO2 emissions from car trips to the poles.According to the director of Public Lighting in Salvador, Júnior Magalhães, the program changed the concept of public lighting in the city as it promoted the democratization and modernization of lighting to entire neighborhoods, including some of the most peripheral neighborhoods, bringing LED light to all streets and alleys, including the installation of new poles. The program was not started in wealthy neighborhoods, but in vulnerable ones, where there is usually a higher rate of problems related to violence. Public lighting brings, in addition to the quality of life, a greater sense of security for those who walk the streets at night.The process for replacing LED lights starts with a field study conducted by DSIP teams to understand the needs of each location. This includes the number of lights and installation requirements to ensure that the whole neighborhood and its inhabitants receive adequate public lighting. In addition, the Municipal Government issues public notices for the purchase of lighting fixtures through price registration to reduce costs and be able to reach more neighborhoods.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyMDAwIDEzMzMiIHdpZHRoPSIyMDAwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEzMzMiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYzQwLm9yZyUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZzdGF0aWMlMkZvdGhlcl91cGxvYWRzJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGMjc1NV8xLm9yaWdpbmFsLkpQRyUzRjE2MDgzMTIyMzIiIGRhdGEtdz0iMjAwMCIgZGF0YS1oPSIxMzMzIiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4="/><img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxNjAwIDEwNjciIHdpZHRoPSIxNjAwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEwNjciIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYzQwLm9yZyUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZzdGF0aWMlMkZvdGhlcl91cGxvYWRzJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGMjc1Nl8yLm9yaWdpbmFsLmpwZyUzRjE2MDgzMTIyNDMiIGRhdGEtdz0iMTYwMCIgZGF0YS1oPSIxMDY3IiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4="/><img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyMDAwIDEzMzMiIHdpZHRoPSIyMDAwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEzMzMiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYzQwLm9yZyUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZzdGF0aWMlMkZvdGhlcl91cGxvYWRzJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGMjc1N18zLm9yaWdpbmFsLkpQRyUzRjE2MDgzMTIyNTMiIGRhdGEtdz0iMjAwMCIgZGF0YS1oPSIxMzMzIiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4="/><img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxNjAwIDEwNjciIHdpZHRoPSIxNjAwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEwNjciIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYzQwLm9yZyUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZzdGF0aWMlMkZvdGhlcl91cGxvYWRzJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGMjc1OF80Lm9yaWdpbmFsLmpwZyUzRjE2MDgzMTIyNjMiIGRhdGEtdz0iMTYwMCIgZGF0YS1oPSIxMDY3IiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4="/>

Organic Waste to Biogas in Rio de Janeiro’s Biomethanisation unit
#################################################################################

            February 2020        The Rio de Janeiro collaboration initiative “Biomethanisation Unit – Treatment of the organic fraction of urban solid residues by anaerobic digestion for energy generation and organic compost production” aims at developing and implementing the first Brazilian and Latin American technology to treat the organic fraction of urban solid waste, regardless as to whether it was segregated at the source or not. The unit has the capacity to treat 35 tons per day, which is the equivalent to serving a population of 70,000 people per day. It can produce 10-20 tons of organic compound per day and can generate 3,150 Nm³ of biogas / day or up to 2,408 MWh / year of electricity. Through this pilot initiative, the city intends to identify and validate optimal operational parameters and to establish a new business model for the sector, contributing therefore to the fight against climate change.The biomethanisation technology developed has never been implemented in Brazil or Latin America before. This is a national expertise and technology developed through a partnership between the Methanum Company and the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) over the past 8 years. In order to do so, the technicians have visited more than 200 biomethanisation units worldwide and have found solutions for gaps identified in European technological lines. They were:  The Biomethanisation Unit has the capacity to process 35 tons of urban solid waste per day, equivalent to the waste generated by a population of 70,000 inhabitants on a daily basis. It will avoid the emission of approximately 3,150m³ of biogas per day, equivalent to 14 MtCO2e per year. Moreover, since the Biomethanisation Unit is located in one of the Waste Transfer Stations, part of the received waste will not have to be transported to the landfills. It means that there will be also a reduction of trucks trips between these places and of the emission of greenhouse gases.One should highlight that among the general goals of the strategic initiative “Sustainable Solid Waste Management” (Result Area: “Rio – Green, Clean and Sound”), the City Hall expects to (1) Reduce the amount of waste disposed in landfills, encouraging the conscious participation of the population and sustainable alternatives of disposal; and (2) Promote the generation of energy from the adoption of solid waste treatment techniques, setting as a goal to reduce by 27% by 2020, the amount of solid waste disposed in landfills, as specified in the 2017-2020 Strategic Plan. The initiative aims to contribute locally to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 6, 11 and 12.One of the main goals of the Rio de Janeiro City Hall Strategic Plan 2017-2020 is the reduction of the amount of waste disposed in landfills and increase in the amount of recovery of recyclables and organic fraction. In order to do so, the current pilot biomethanisation unit will have to be scaled. The current plant provides enough data that allows it to be replicated at different scales and with different levels of automation, with varying number of biomethanisation tunnels installed and their dimensions.In order to achieve the Rio’s Plan strategic goals, other complementary initiatives such as pruning composting unit, civil construction waste treatment unit and a waste-energy unit will be developed, with the biomethanisation unit being part of a grater programme towards a better urban solid waste management.

Seattle's Fossil Fuel Free Waste Collection Fleet
#################################################################################

            February 2020        As the majority of Seattle’s climate emissions come from transportation, City leaders are exploring every opportunity to reduce transportation emissions. When the 10-year contract for waste haulers came up for renewal in 2018, Seattle’s waste and water utility—Seattle Public Utilities—saw an excellent opportunity to use their leverage to implement a major change in waste hauling services.Seattle’s new waste fleet includes 200 new clean emissions vehicles powered by electricity, renewable natural gas, and renewable diesel. This includes two full size 100% electricity recycling trucks.Seattle is one of the first cities in the nation to mandate that contracted waste haulers transition to a renewable fuels fleet. This is helping drive market share for alternative fuel heavy duty vehicles in the region.Heavy duty vehicles have typically been powered by diesel fuel. By transitioning to a waste hauling fleet that is fossil fuel free, Seattle is actively reducing the impacts of their own operations. With significant advancements in electric vehicles and alternative fuel technologies, the challenges of cost or logistics are no longer barriers to transitioning to a heavy-duty fleet that does not run on fossil fuels.  Seattle Public Utilities recognised they had a once-a-decade opportunity to improve service delivery, reduce climate and air pollution impacts, and drive market share for trucks that run on clean technology.  Both the renewable natural gas and renewable diesel trucks have state-of-the-art engines and controls that produce near-zero or ultra-low emissions. Rounding out the fleet are electric trucks powered by Seattle’s carbon neutral electricity. This includes 2 full-size recycle route trucks, 4 mid-size trucks for smaller routes and container delivery, and 8 small electric-support trucks or cars.The aim of this project is to continue to keep future solid waste rates low while still providing excellent customers service. It is expected to result in savings of around $5 million annually.

Sunset Park: Community Solar Energy in NYC
#################################################################################

            February 2020        <a href="https://sunsetparksolar.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Sunset Park Solar</a>Through a partnership with the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC), Sunset Park Solar is being developed on the roof of the Brooklyn Army Terminal, a City-owned industrial park. The project team includes non-profits NYCEDC (the public partner on behalf of the City of New York), has structured the project so that the public sector will contribute the full value of the real estate required to the project, as long as the project is effective in reaching the policy goals of providing below-market clean energy to local subscribers. This is an innovative public-private partnership (PPP) that demonstrates municipal leadership in delivering PPP to foster the community solar market in NYC.As a cooperative, each subscriber-member has a vote in deciding how to invest the cooperative’s resources, including any operating profit from the solar installation. The profit can be reinvested in additional solar projects, used to launch complementary energy efficiency campaigns, or distributed to members as dividends. The cooperative convenes regular meetings that are open to all members, where issues relating to Sunset Park Solar and additional projects being developed by the cooperative can be discussed and voted on.The idea for community-owned solar comes out of efforts from the climate justice community to operationalise just transitions. Its goal is to make it possible for communities to start moving off the grid and to start creating utilities or mechanisms that will help them thrive in the face of climate change. Apart from catalysing transition away from fossil fuels to clean energy, this approach also aims to serve as an economic driver for working class communities.The programme is estimated to generate 19.6 million kWh of solar electricity over 25 years, which will provide an estimated 13,056 tons of CO2 equivalent emissions reduction.By creating a low carbon energy network, the project will mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and support city renewable energy targets. The The Sunset Solar Park project is a pilot with an initial lease of 25 years and serves as a model for future projects. It can be expanded on the roof where it is located, within other portions of the Brooklyn Army Terminal campus, and/or to other buildings in the NYC Economic Development Corporation’s portfolio of 60M + sq. ft located across the five boroughs of the city.

            February 2020        The Through the  The Home Energy Score program is now in its second year of implementation. Over 11,000 scores have been disclosed and the market is beginning to show early signs of compliance with and acceptance of the new requirement.The innovative elements of City of Portland Home Energy Score include:Home energy scoring and disclosure are among the few policy tools available to local governments that can lead to residential carbon emission reductions. This is especially true in jurisdictions like Portland, where the city does not control building and energy codes, nor does it have much control over the utility sector. Home Energy Score is a long-term market transformation policy that will take a decade or two to have an impact. The ultimate goal of this policy is to increase substantially the adoption of residential deep energy retrofits that will reduce carbon emissions from homes by 2040.Judging from analyses made by the municipality, the Home Energy Score could reduce residential carbon emissions 25% by 2030 (approximately 5 million tons of CO2e).It will require upgrading tens of thousands of homes on an annual basis to reach this goal. This represents a level of consumer adoption of energy efficiency that vastly outpaces typical market activity. In 2012, Portland achieved a market high of 2,000 energy retrofits conducted in one year. These projects were orchestrated by

San Francisco's Transportation Demand Management Programme
#################################################################################

            February 2020        The San Francisco Transportation Demand Management (TDM) programme applies throughout San Francisco and leverages the amount of proposed parking at a project’s site to provide TDM measures, such as on-site amenities that encourage the site’s residents, employees, and/or visitors to choose more sustainable modes of travel. On-site amenities include, but are not limited to extra bike parking, carshare spaces and memberships, delivery supportive amenities, on-site childcare, subsidised transit passes, and lowered parking supply. The choices that result from having access to the amenities are better for the environment, reduce project-related congestion, reduce risks to pedestrians and cyclists and improve the overall efficiency of San Francisco’s transportation network. Each TDM measure is controlled by the property owner and is rooted in the best available research and data on their effectiveness at reducing vehicle miles travelled (VMT), and thus transportation-related emissions. The programme is structured in two ways: 1) the programme’s legal framework, applicability, exemptions, and timing requirements are codified in the The TDM programme Standards are located outside of the Code so that they can be amended at any time with the approval from the Planning Commission. The TDM programme Standards are based on the California Senate Bill 743 (2013) which set out to modernise the environmental planning process that calculates the effects of transportation. In 2016, the San Francisco Planning Commission adopted a Level of Service (LOS) methodology with a vehicle-miles travelled threshold. It allowed San Francisco to immediately implement changes to how it analyses environmental impacts of vehicles miles travelled (VMT) rather than wait for state adoption. In 2017, the same Commission adopted the TDM programme, which now applies to all new developments. Compared to the traditional Level of Service methodology, which only measures how many cars can be pushed through an intersection at a given time, the new TDM programme Standards instead measure whether a project contributes to state, regional and local goals such as reducing GHG emissions.The programme applies to all new development that fits the following criteria: Based on the entire 2018 Q4 Development Pipeline, 17% of all projects, regardless of size, are subject to the TDM programme, accounting for 97% of all upcoming dwelling units.The San Francisco Transportation Demand Management programme is designed to reduce:Policies that reduce VMT in San Francisco will also reduce fine particulates, and ozone precursors (reactive organic gases and nitrogen oxides) which will improve air quality and public health.A co-benefit to the full implementation of the propgramme is a change in behaviour that is linked to more sustainable travel decisions and action being made. The programme was adopted on March 19, 2017 and its implementation mirrors the pace of development in San Francisco. Since its adoption, 163 TDM Plans have been filed, 157 are actively under review, and 38 are already recorded on the deeds of the project properties (25%). As of mid- 2019, 7% of the TDM Plans under review were under construction and one was completed.

San Francisco Carpet Requirements for City Departments
#################################################################################

            February 2020        In 2016, the City of San Francisco, through its Department of the Environment (SFE), engaged a range of stakeholders to create a This type of multi-faceted regulation did not exist before the implementation of this specific policy. While ecolabels for environmentally preferable carpet products were available, none fully addressed all these issues. Thus carpet recycling feedstocks still contained undesirable chemicals such as phthalates and heavy metals which threaten recycling efforts.The Carpet Purchasing regulation is the most comprehensive and stringent of its kind and has been recognised by leading standard-setting organisations (San Francisco City municipal buildings use more than 15 million square feet (4.5 million square meters) of carpet, therefore this initiative has a tremendous market and environmental impact potential. While compliant carpet products will not be cheaper than rolled carpets, there will nonetheless be savings related to maintenance. Since the regulation calls for using carpet tiles instead of broadloom (rolled carpet), carpeted areas will be easier to maintain as tiles are easier to remove, recycle, and replace than a soiled area of rolled carpet. In addition, with rolled carpets, users would generally have to pay a fee to dispose of the entire carpet in the landfill.The purchasing requirements provide a range of environmental benefits by reducing the use of virgin materials, thus reducing GHG emissions, improving air quality, protecting and conserving water, reducing landfill disposal, and promoting transparency. The regulation aims to: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC). This common carpet chemical has phthalates which can disrupt hormones and cause cancer. It can also contain lead (which can cause reproductive and nerve disorders).Antimicrobial chemicals. These create antibiotic-resistant bacteria and disrupt hormones and are not necessary for city carpets.Flame retardant chemicals. These do little, if anything, to slow or prevent fire. They migrate into air, dust and our bodies and are associated with cancer and reproductive harm.  Teflon-like, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances. These provide stain resistance but are associated with cancer and obesity. They migrate into air, dust, water and our bodies. They never degrade and are generally not necessary, particularly as there are stain-resistant carpet yarns available without those chemicals.  The regulation already applies to all City carpet purchases and SFE has trained approximately 100 city staff procuring products. SFE is currently exploring the development of a regulation for other flooring options.After the regulation for municipal buildings passed, many groups contacted the City to discuss replicating the regulation requirements. City staff have provided one-on-one technical assistance to other governments, schools and universities, and advocacy groups such as Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, Health Care Without Harm, Ecology Center, and Green Science Policy Institute. Though the regulation currently applies only to City purchases, private architecture firms who work on City projects are also specifying SFE approved products for their other projects. SFE is a founding member of the Manufacturers with compliant product options are promoting these throughout San Francisco and beyond for all types of building projects. So, while the city is not scaling the project locally, this initiative is being adopted by businesses, universities and other cities around the world. *. C2C’s Material Health evaluation criteria is recognised internationally for building products.

This policy is an implementation tool of the Boston Smart Utilities Vision, a multi-departmental initiative for more sustainable, resilient, equitable and innovative utility services across energy, water, transit, and telecom. The policy calls for the integration of five Smart Utility Technologies (SUTs) into new large projects. Specific to energy, this policy requires proponents of new developments 1.5 million square feet or larger to submit a technical and financial feasibility assessment for advanced energy systems, including a district energy microgrid. The assessment is reviewed by the Smart Utilities Program Steering Committee and the Interagency Green Building Committee. If an advanced system is feasible, developers must produce a District Energy Microgrid Master Plan, which coordinates the phasing-in of the energy system with the phasing-in of the development. Because four separate utility sectors share the City’s space underground, the program will foster more efficient and effective deployment of Smart Utility Technologies.<b>What is the project? How does it work?</b>Boston’s requirement for large developments to study and install district energy microgrids is a first in the country. By addressing the concrete technical, legal, regulatory, and financial issues associated with private, multi-user local energy systems, it will provide a model for others.District Energy Microgrids are a novel way of addressing specific vulnerability concerns for large developments. When major flooding or other storm events knock out power on the grid, the district energy microgrid continues to provide both electricity and thermal energy. The district energy component means that heating and cooling is generated as a by-product of other generation, limiting and at times eliminating the need for energy produced by a fossil fuel furnace. While the regulation currently only applies to developments over 1.5 million square feet, its successful implementation will stand as an example of what is possible for both district energy and microgrids in the city.The district energy microgrid feasibility assessment required by the Smart Utilities Policy will be adjusted over time to support the evolution of carbon neutrality policies and programs.<b>What are the CO2 reduction goals?</b>Under the policy, project proponents assess advanced energy system benefits in terms of GHG emission reduction, resilience, and cost reduction. Projects under review are resulting in greater amounts of cogeneration, which achieve significant GHG reductions compared to business-as-usual energy systems, as well as in an increased amount of rooftop solar and other renewables.The Smart Utilities Policy aims to create new development that is resilient to the expected increase in storms and sea level rise. The District Energy Microgrid technology should allow developments greater than 1.5 million square feet to “island” themselves and disconnect from the grid during power outages and continue to provide thermal energy and electricity. The program supports economic development by attracting businesses through world-class, modern, efficient, and cheaper utility services. The deployment of Smart Utility Technologies aims to support the creation of jobs, as highlighted in the Resilient Boston report of 2016. Requiring street light poles to be designed with extra electrical and fiber optics enable future smart technology city-wide, supporting innovation and smart technology businesses. A goal of the program is to lower the cost of utility services. District Energy Microgrids will reduce energy costs through energy efficiency. A Telecom Utilidor will eliminate entry barriers for new companies by eliminating the need for street opening for infrastructure installation.<b>Next Steps</b>By embedding this policy into the review of large development areas, the program will achieve deployment across the City. Although the District Energy Microgrid policy currently applies only to the largest project, it is likely that these solutions will be applicable to smaller projects in the future.

The refreshed strategy has been guided both by the municipality’s understanding of climate risks and strategic priorities identified by the community. The strategy outlines how the city will deliver and advocate for effective adaptation through five strategic adaptation goals:  The City of Melbourne municipality has 170,000 residents but greater Melbourne includes over 4 million. Each day City of Melbourne has close to one million visitors. This strategy refresh aims to create a city that can adapt well to climate change and continue to prosper and thrive.<b>What is the project? How does it work?</b>Many cities are now developing Climate Change Adaptation Strategies but Melbourne is one of the first cities worldwide to refresh their strategy and review their action plan based on current best practice and knowledge. The refreshed strategy is moving the city in a new direction. The review showed a need for Melbourne to shift focus from adapting internal assets and processes to working more with external organisations, the community and the private realm. As there are many players making decisions that affect change in Melbourne, the city must work with its partners more effectively to ensure that it protects citizens and achieves the potential economic, social and environmental co-benefits that planning for climate change can bring.
New areas of focus include communicating with small and medium business to ensure they continue to prosper during extreme weather events; increasing permeable surfaces to reduce impacts of flooding; appropriately greening the city in both the public and private realm to help cool the city and improve biodiversity; and developing extreme weather plans to ensure support is provided to vulnerable communities during these events.<b>What are the CO2 reduction goals?</b>The City of Melbourne’s CO2 reduction goals are outlined in <b>Next Steps</b>Following the strategy refresh, Melbourne is able to share its approach, plans and actions with other councils and support them to establish their own adaptation plans.

To meet these goals, Hong Kong has implemented “ACT” strategies to enhance building energy efficiency through legislation and collaboration.  <b>What is the project? How does it work?</b>The “ACT” acronym stands for “Accelerate, Collaboration and Technology”.

<u>Technology</u><b>What are the CO2 reduction goals?</b>Since 2012, over 800 new buildings and about 7,000 retrofitting works on existing buildings have complied with BEEO’s building energy requirements. The estimated saving from BEEO is 1,500 million kWh/year in 2020 with contribution from the new building energy codes. With full implementation of latest phase of energy efficiency labelling schemes in Dec 2019, Hong Kong aims to save 625 million kWh/year. Electricity end use of 8 types of electrical appliances accounts for 70% of total consumption in the residential sector.EMSD has collaborated with the Hong Kong Green Building Council to carry out retro-commissioning  pilot projects on private and public buildings. An average annual energy saving of 5% was achieved. With such good results, the city will roll out retro-commissioning  on 280 government buildings over 7 years starting in 2019. Through Dialogue Platform, key stakeholders of The Buildings Energy Efficiency Ordinance (BEEO) is estimated to save 1,500 million kWh a year in 2020 (reduce carbon emissions by 1.06 million tonnes). Up to 2028, BEEO will bring 27 billion kWh accumulated energy savings from new and existing buildings, equivalent to total carbon emissions reduction of 19 million tonnes. Buildings that perform well on energy efficiency are crucial for better livability and “smart” low carbon living. Upon the full implementation of the 3rd phase of the Mandatory Energy Efficiency Labelling Scheme in Dec 2019, it will save 625 million kWh per annum (reduce carbon emissions by 440,000 tonnes). Through dialogue platform and engagement, key 4Ts partners from the building sector have set their energy saving plans (2015-20) with total saving of 230 million kWh (reduce carbon emissions by 160,000 tonnes).  All above measures could save over 2.2 billion kWh in 2020 (reduce carbon emissions by over 1.5 million tonnes). Hong Kong’s energy intensity was reduced by 28% in 2016 from 2005 level, becoming the lowest among all 21 APEC economies.<b>Next Steps</b>The retro-commissioning solutions are not only promoted in Hong Kong, but also in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) of China. The Electrical and Mechanical Services Department, together with the Hong Kong Green Building Council and the Building Services Operation and Maintenance Executives Society, signed a MoC in November 2018 with 4 universities and professional bodies in the Mainland and Macao to promote the development and application of retro-commissioning solutions for buildings in the GBA. Through collaboration among these partners, it is expected that various organizations in the GBA and other Mainland cities will further collaborate to adopt retro-commissioning solutions as a new solution for achieving building energy efficiency through knowledge sharing, training and conference exchanges. <a href="http://https://www.enb.gov.hk/sites/default/files/pdf/EnergySavingPlanEn.pdf">Energy Saving Plan for Hong Kong’s Built Environment 2015~2025+</a><a href="https://www.climateready.gov.hk/">Hong Kong’s Climate Action Plan 2030+</a>

In this sense, with the residential sector as a target, the PASATE A LED project has been designed. It is a lamp replacement program that seeks to promote the efficient use of energy in homes through LED lighting. This project is the continuation of a previous one focused on lamps replacement in vulnerable neighborhoods of the City, started in October 2017 and completed in June 2018.<b>What is the project? How does it work</b>What makes this project innovative is the effective replacement of the lamps. This allows to properly dispose used lamps. On the one hand, fluorescent lamps containing mercury undergo a treatment that makes their final disposal safe and, on the other hand, lamps that do not have contaminating material are crushed and used as raw material for the manufacture of the City's tiles. This strategy supports the change to a low-carbon and efficient economy.Unlike other cities, this project places a special emphasis on the future replacement of LED lamps, ensuring that the energy saving is not moot. It is also the first project of its kind at this level of magnitude. The replacement of up to 3 million LED lamps is currently being considered.<b>What are the CO2 reduction goals/achievements?</b>So far, 162,757 households out of the planned 325,000 homes have been reached. 740,613 lamps were delivered in the first phase of the project, which implies an equivalent of 21,367 tCO2e reduced out of a planned 43,000 tCO2e total. The citizens of Buenos Aires will have a significant saving in energy consumption that will be reflected on their electricity bill, with 14% less energy spent on average.To date, $3 million USD has been saved for the residents of the City, with an expected $100 million USD to be saved over the course of the project.With the decrease of electrical energy demand, there will be less reliance on thermal energy sources. This action is directly carried out to mitigate the effects caused by climate change. Another benefit of the program is provided thanks to the long life of the lightbulbs, which are able to extend up to 10 years. In total, 45.2 GWh will be saved for the residents of the City, which is equivalent to the consumption of 13,627 homes per year.<b>Next Steps</b>The city is planning on scaling up the project. In less than a year since the beginning of the project, 740,613 lamps have been replaced and an open purchase order has recently been initiated to have more stock of lamps available (up to 3 million). <strong>Links to further information</strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7O1u_jONTw&amp;feature=youtu.be">Promotional Video for the Campaign</a>

Particularly since 2014, a series of climatic events which impacted the infrastructure, and population health, including causing many deaths, highlighted the need for more information and the proposal of concrete measures to address these issues.<b>What is the project? How does it work</b>Workshops were developed aimed at population groups of great vulnerability. The city focused on the elderly population to inform them about heat waves, and on the Matanza-Riachuelo Basin population to inform them about floods. Hence, the workshops allowed neighbours to come together to exchange views about climate issues and strategies to address them.<b>What are the CO2 reduction goals?</b>This project is oriented towards improving the resilience of its population. It does so with the following strategies:Overall results of the program from 2017 to the present:  Bringing out social benefits, the project aimed to empower citizens in the decision-making process, creating a space for articulation between government and neighbours, and generate spaces the exchange of strategies, informations and solutions regarding climate change among neighbours.<b>Next Steps</b>The Climate Change Management plans to scale this project by training other government areas that work with vulnerable populations (environmental references in informal settlements, environmental volunteers, promoters, and public health personnel) and representatives of civil society organizations so that these referents replicate the workshops in the 15 communes of the city with the objective of tripling the scope of the workshops in the next two years.

The program allows the City to share the work it is undertaking through a grassroots focused strategy, while also empowering and educating residents to take personalized climate action on their own. City staff prepare and periodically update a core presentation and script on the City’s climate and energy programs and the ways that individuals can take action. They also reach out to the community through social media and through community partners to recruit potential leaders and ambassadors. Leaders attend a three-hour workshop to review the core presentation materials and learn how to customize it to reflect their communities’ needs and interests. Supported by stipends, they host their own events and issue their own invitations, and report results to the City. Ambassadors make a longer-term commitment, participating in monthly meetings and learning to conduct the Leaders training on their own. <b>What is the project? How does it work</b>Launched in 2017 as Climate Ready Boston Community Leaders, the program set out to raise awareness of the recent climate preparedness plan and engage more residents, particularly in vulnerable neighborhoods, in climate action. The Leaders and Ambassadors program is innovating in ways to connect climate action and planning to individual and neighborhood engagement. It starts by recognizing the seriousness and the capability of Boston residents to communicate effectively the core information, goals, and resources of climate action in our city. The City then supports that communication with accessible information and presentations specifically designed to be creatively customized, and with staff and financial resources that assist participants in reaching out to their communities in the way that they know is best. Finally, it creates a network of people in the neighborhoods who can share stories with each other and with City staff and leadership that help city government to improve policies, programs, and presentations that produce more effective action.<b>What are the CO2 reduction goals?</b>The Leaders and Ambassadors program aims to decrease carbon emissions by helping residents identify and undertake specific climate actions most appropriate for themselves. These actions range from making their own homes more efficient and increasing recycling, to using bicycles rather than cars. This program is evaluated in terms of participation, not quantified carbon reductions, but there are no specific goals.Nearly 300 people in four cohorts have been or are going through the training and have held events with over 1,500 attendees, so far. The leaders and ambassadors themselves and those attending their events have acquired knowledge of actionable items to help themselves, friends, family, and community reduce GHG emissions.Because the Leaders and Ambassador program is built upon the idea that residents themselves are the best messenger for information that the city develops, the goal for the program is to expand the networks of people taking climate action within neighborhoods This increases the ability of the community to participate in and even lead climate policy and program development as it pertains to their neighborhood.Additionally, the trained Leaders and Ambassadors have successfully held events where they have communicated the City’s vulnerability reduction plans to their broader community and to other local residents.

It is the primary roadmap to assign budgets and regulatory frameworks for urban development and contains policies, regulations, strategic projects, programmes, and indicators relevant to the below areas: One of the three key policies of the POT is the Eco-efficiency Policy. Its objective is to ensure that by 2031, Bogotá will have a responsible and efficient management system within its entire territory. This policy will be materialized through concrete mitigation and adaptation measures such as: <b>What is the policy? How does it work?</b>Bogotá has been a national leader in urban regulation. This new policy builds on the previous urban plan, integrating lessons in terms of monitoring and evaluation, budget assignment and governance. Many cities in Colombia (small, medium or large scale) will be able to learn from this new 2.0 version of the urban regulation, as this is the first time that an urban regulation in Colombia tackles climate change in such a concrete way. The narrative around climate change adopted in the plan is clear and results-oriented, and it has been included in the strategic chapter in order to permeate as many aspects of the plan as possible.<b>What are the CO2 reduction goals/achievements?</b>The 2019 Bogotá City Master Plan tackles emissions reduction from all key sectors. It aims to transform the city model and orientate new developments and future densification areas around public transportation nods in order to disincentive the use of private cars. Currently, 9 lines of Bogota’s bus rapid transit (BRT) system have been built. The plan aims to add two additional BRT lines and the first metro line in Bogota.  Finally, this Master Plan expects to implement a programme of ecological rehabilitation in non-mitigated high-risk areas. Today Bogotá has 26.6 ha of these areas, which should expand to 240 ha by 2031. The city aims to resettle 6,315 homes due to houses located in high-risk areas. The city also hopes to increase the number of sustainable drainage areas from 2 in 2018 to 40 in 2031.

There were about 400 trams operating until then. Eventually, with the introduction of the underground metro (the first in India) and subsequently the expansion of the new metro lines complemented by the upgrade of bus services and the proliferation of private motor vehicles, the ridership of trams declined. There was no concerted effort for reviving the trams until then. This also resulted in the decline of the upkeep of tram bogeys. In contrast, trams were abolished in other cities, e.g. Bombay, Delhi and Chennai. The City of Kolkata retained its tram system and it still continues to remain a prominent mode of public transport although the ridership numbers have declined significantly. The challenge faced by Kolkata is the limited supply of land for road space. Kolkata has only the 7% of its land area dedicated to road space, of which 1% has been lost to encroachments bringing down the effective road space to 6%. With the proliferation of private vehicles, taxis and two-wheelers, it has become exceedingly difficult to retain and maintain an efficient tram network. According to the tram authorities, in order for the trams to work more efficiently there is the need to de-reserve the rights of way. Also, trams in Kolkata are old fashioned, noisy and slow, and partly because of this their routes have been truncated causing ridership to suffer. The strategic task facing the government now is how to leverage the old assets of the tram company to leap into the 21st century.Trams are more than merely a means of transportation – they represent the city's soul and heritage (only city in India with a trams network). They serve as a mode of public transportation but also provide heritage tours for visitors. At present there are 40 to 45 trams currently plying on 7 to 8 existing routes covering a total of 40 kms. These comprise of both single and double bogey trams with a total ridership of 10,000 to 12,000 daily passengers.  The table below gives a brief chronology of the developmet of tramways in Kolkata since 1880. <img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMTUzIDkwMyIgd2lkdGg9IjExNTMiIGhlaWdodD0iOTAzIiBkYXRhLXU9Imh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGd3d3LmM0MC5vcmclMkZ3cC1jb250ZW50JTJGc3RhdGljJTJGb3RoZXJfdXBsb2FkcyUyRmltYWdlcyUyRjI1MzJfU2NyZWVuc2hvdF8yMDIwLTAxLTMwX2F0XzEyLjMwLjQ1Lm9yaWdpbmFsLnBuZyUzRjE1ODAzODc1NDUiIGRhdGEtdz0iMTE1MyIgZGF0YS1oPSI5MDMiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/>Trams are maintained by the Trams Engineering Section while their movement is regulated by the Traffic Department. The Permanent Way Department is responsible for ensuring the right of way while the Overhead Cables Department is responsible for the transmission of electricity. The supply of electricity to run the trams is provided by Calcutta Electricity Supply Company.The 6kV A/C power is converted to D/C in 10 sub-stations and is then stepped down to 415 Volt A/C which is further converted to 550 D/C through a rectifier and carried through cables to the desired location where electricity is connected to the overhead cables.<b>Next Steps</b>In 2020, the West Bengal Transport Company (WBTC) plans to introduce ten single bogey air conditioned tram cars, increasing the fleet to 55 trams, aiming to increment their appeal. At present, WBTC is looking at capacity enhancement and at improving and maintaining the existing routes. The trams remain perhaps the most sustainable solution for the city’s public transportation system.Figure 1: Existing 40 kms of Tram routes Source: Calcutta Tramways Company, WBTC.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA4NjQgODc5IiB3aWR0aD0iODY0IiBoZWlnaHQ9Ijg3OSIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyNTI1X0tvbGthdGFNYXAub3JpZ2luYWwucG5nJTNGMTU4MDM3OTk5MiIgZGF0YS13PSI4NjQiIGRhdGEtaD0iODc5IiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4="/>Figure 2: New Air Conditioned Tram Bogeys<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA0NDEgMzMxIiB3aWR0aD0iNDQxIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjMzMSIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyNTI2X0tvbGthdGFUcmFtMi5vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmclM0YxNTgwMzgwMDExIiBkYXRhLXc9IjQ0MSIgZGF0YS1oPSIzMzEiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/>

The scope of these studies cover the entirety of all flood-prone areas in Hong Kong, and led to the construction of 2,400 km of storm water drainage pipes, 360 km of river channels, 21 km of drainage tunnels, 4 underground flood storage tanks and 27 village polder schemes; all infrastructure projects that led to significantly reduced flood risk. <b>What is the innovation? How does it work?</b>The DSD’s Inter-Reservoir Transfer Scheme (IRTS) is a remarkable innovation serving the dual purpose of improving flood protection levels and achieving water conservation. The IRTS transfers collected surface runoff between reservoirs, thereby creating a designated storage capacity to receive further runoff from the catchment, as well as reducing the reservoir overflow to the downstream urban area. This will significantly reduce the risk of flooding. It will also generate an annual additional fresh water yield of 3.4M m3 with minimal recurrent costs.In addition, the plan also encapsulates many revitalisation projects for the city’s rivers. The Ho Chung, Upper Lam Tsuen and Kai Tak rivers are gradually being revitalised into green rivers while revitalisation projects for the Tsui Ping River and the Yuen Long Nullah are under planning. Notably, Hong Kong’s first river park is being envisaged along Tung Chung River in Lantau Island where the public will be able to spend leisure time at the river’s bank. Passive designs such as boardwalks, viewing decks and footpaths are planned. In order to balance out the environmental impact and the influx of new visitors, native vegetation will be preserved to maintain the existing habitat at the upstream of Tung Chung River. The river park will provide the public a crucial social and ecological resource to nurture a water friendly culture in the city.Additionally, the city has been able to innovate in the way it constructs underground flood storage facilities. The Happy Valley underground storage tank with a volume of 60,000 m3 was constructed underneath a series of football pitches. This concept not only achieves low-impact urban development and land co-usage, it also avoids the large-scale downstream drainage improvement works. Moreso, the use of smart movable weirs prevents pre-mature filling of the tank, thus maximising the effectiveness of the storage capacity, allowing for a smaller tank design. The project also aims to reduce the flood risk in Hong Kong by formulating a new drainage provision which: (i) adopts either a Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) at a 4.5 or 6.0 scenario recommended in the IPCC 5Hong Kong is prone to very heavy rainstorms, and experienced substantial flooding during the 1990s. With completion of major flood prevention works formulated in the DMP and DMP reviews, the number of areas of high flooding risk (blackspots) have been significantly reduced from 90 (in 1995) to 6 (in 2019). All major flooding blackspots, affecting areas of more than 100 hectares or resulting in serious social and economic disruption, were eliminated by 2010. Improved flood prevention standards now safeguards 7.4 million citizens. In the midst of growing threats by climate change, Hong Kong was hit by super typhoons Hato and Mangkhut in 2017 and 2018, and although the super typhoons brought major disruptions throughout the city, there were no fatal incidents thanks to Hong Kong’s robust and reliable flood prevention infrastructure. <b>Next Steps</b>To date, the DSD has completed DMP reviews for 6 drainage basins, covering an area of approximately 520 km2. Designs of the proposed drainage improvements works, taking into account the effects of climate change and revitalisation concepts, are underway. A DMP review for 4 more drainage basins with an area of approximately 310 km2 is currently on-going and set for completion by the end of 2020. A DMP review for the remaining basins with area of 80 km2 is scheduled for completion by 2030.

It is estimated that Hanoi generates 5,500 to 6,000 tons of domestic waste every day, of which plastic accounts for 8-10%. This domestic waste is unsorted and is typically transported to landfills. This method accounts for 76% of waste disposal in Ho Chi Minh City and 95% of Hanoi’s waste disposal, with the remaining waste trated by inceneration methods or recycled at craft villages.Neither method brings environmental or economic benefits. Landfills waste land resources, state budgets and has social costs. The value of recyclable materials are wasted, ground and surface water are affected by secondary pollution and, in the long term, even land is affected. Incineration avoids some of these problems with landfills, but requires a huge upfront investment and involves a long implementation time. Dioxin emissions by incenerators also pose an environment problem. These projects also come under the objection of local residents.Accordingly, Vietnam discharges between 280,000 and 730,000 tons of plastic into the ocean per year, accounting for 6% of plastic waste in the world’s oceans (ranking fourth in the world, according to a UNEP workshop).Hanoi City implemented a “school milk” program, in which the City subidzes the price of milk as to ensure adequate dairy intake among the city’s children. This has caused the volume of discarded milk cartons from schools to be large. Milk boxes consist of 75% paper, 21% aluminium and 4% plastic. Although all these materials are recyclable, these cartons are disposed of in general waste bins and thus poured directly into landfills.Facing this situation, Hanoi City collaborated with Tetra Pak Vietnam (a major milk carton producer), Lagom Vietnam (a recycling company) and NHC Social Enterprise to launch a pilot program to facilitate the collection, sorting and recycling of milk cartons in kindergardens and primary schools throughout the city. The program does not only recycle large quantities of milk cartons (minimizing the amount of waste for landfills), but also raises the pupils’ awareness of environmental issues and responsible waste separation habits.<b>What is the project? How does it work?</b>The Hanoi Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DONRE), Hanoi Department of Education and Training (DOET), Tetra Pak Vietnam Joint Stock Company, Lagom Vietnam Co., Ltd. and NHC Social Enterprises have established a program coordinating the process of collecting and recucling 100% of milk cartons among the registered schools in Hanoi. In particular, Tetra Pak Vietnam has a social responsibility to return its waste to resources by supporting the program’s communication initiatives. Through NHC Social Enterprises, the program has experts instructing teachers and pupils on how to best collect, classify, treat, and store milk cartons as to avoid unpleasant odors. Lagom Vietnam Co., Ltd are responsible for ensuring that 100% of milk cartons are processesd into other products such as paper, construction materials, etc…This pilot program will act as the foundation for Hanoi DONRE and DOET to develop a citywide program in all schools and residential areas in Hanoi city in the future.<b>What are the CO2 reduction goals and achievements?</b>Since the start of the program, 100 tons of milk cartons have been collected and the program is projected to reduce over 1,000 tons of milk cartons per year, which will help mitigate 111 tons of methane at landfills. The CO2 reduction goals of this programme sit at around 2.78 thousand tCO2e/year.<b>Next Steps</b>Judging from the preliminary results of the program, Hanoi will gradually expand to all 30 districts of the city in the coming years, which will cover over 4,000 schools. Simultaneously, Hanoi will continue to cimplement models of collecting, sorting and recycling plastic waste in offices, businesses and residential areas, in order to minimize the amount of waste discharged into the environment.<b>Links to further Information </b><a href="http://taichevohopsua.com/trang-chu-EN">Official Programme Page</a><b>Contact Details</b>Ms. Le Thanh ThuyProject Management and Communication DivisionHanoi Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)Hanoi Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DONRE)<i>Tel: +84 983376658</i><i>Fax +84 4 37833926</i><i>Email: </i>

GO AIT-VN focuses on key domains of consumption and the establishment of EMSs through behavioral changes and contexts/norms for nurturing and promoting sustainable lifestyles instead of adjusting infrastructures/ facilities.Enterprises and organizations can implement the GO program with internal resources following GO AIT-VN guidelines and register for GO AIT-VN certification. Based on assessment and certified indicators, AIT-VN provides two levels of certification: Standard and Advanced.The GO AIT-VN guidelines present a roadmap on how to set up a Green Office through training on behavior change and sustainable consumption. It also provides tools for GHG emission and inventory calculations. AIT-VN provides the training of trainers (ToT) to become internal experts in GO implementation that helps enterprises and organizations in executing GO and build capacity for employees. Participants of the ToT will be equipped with knowledge of sustainable consumption, climate change, Greenhouse Gas (GHG) and skills on behavior change training and GO management system setup.<b>What is the project? How does it work?</b>The Green Office program is an environmental management system for offices that focuses on raising awareness and driving behaviour changes towards sustainable consumption practices. This program not only reduces direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but also reduces operational costs through reduced wastage of electricity, water, paper, and other resources.<b>What are the CO2 reduction achievments?</b>Since the implementation, GHG emissions were reduced by 10.9% per capita at the DONRE office. Overall reduction across the organisation was 4.2.%<b>Next Steps</b>Continuous improvements are being carried out under the Green Office program at the DONRE office.<strong>Links to Further Information</strong><a href="https://green-inno.vn/en/green-office/">“Green Office” Official Website</a><strong>Contact Details</strong>Ms. Le Thanh ThuyProject Management and Communication DivisionHanoi Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)Hanoi Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DONRE)<i>Tel: +84 983376658</i><i>Fax +84 4 37833926</i><i>Email: </i>

The new Eni fuel is constituted of 15% renewable content (waste cooking oil) which will be supplied to the Venetian public transport company at the same cost as usual diesel. The main purpose of this agreement is to test new technologies that will help implement the circular economy. <i>Signatory bodies involved in this agreement:</i>In Marghera, ENI has realized the conversion of a conventional refinery into a biorefinery. The raw materials of biological origin, including waste vegetable oil and animal fat, are transformed into high quality biofuels called Enidiesel+.Waste cooking oil produced by citizens is collected by VERITAS in several collection bins located throughout the City (both in the historic center and the mainland) and taken to the Eni bio-refinery in Marghera to be transformed into biodiesel (Eni Diesl +). This will then be used by ACTV as fuel for its lagoon boat fleet.This agreement is important in It is estimated that the 3.13 tons of CO2e and 1.9 mc of water/ton is saved for each ton of biodiesel.<b><i>What were the main challenges?</i></b>Biodiesel is more expensive than traditional diesel. For the sake of experimenting with the concept, ENI supplied ACTV with its biodiesel without any additional costs.Furthermore, ACTV and ENI conducted special tests on engines powered by biodiesel according to a test protocol standard for the analysis of emissions and consumption, in collaboration with the University of Venice Ca’Foscari and the Naples National Research Council (CNR).VERITAS undertook the task to assign the same technical and economic conditions to the operators who will take the collected waste oil (after purification) to the ENI bio-refinery. <b><i>What are the next steps?</i></b>The agreement was meant to last for only seven months, but thanks to its success, the agreement is still in place. Furthermore, Veritas was inspired by the results of this experiment with biofuels and has the intention to start using biodiesel for its own fleet. The ENI bio-refinery is planning to improve its processing capacity to around 560,000 tons of oil by 2021. This will see ENI increase its share of raw materials derived from food production waste, with a total production of green diesel that will reach to around 420,000 tons / year.<b>Links to further information (in Italian)</b><b><i>Contact details:  </i></b>City of Venice<i>Strategic and Environmental Project Department</i>Location: Campo Manin – S.Marco 4023 – 30124 Venice tel + 39 041 274 7974<a href="%22mailto:">servizio.ambiente@comune.venezia.it</a>web: comune.venezia.it/clima

With the development of the city, a thermal power plant with installed capacity of 1.06 million kilowatts was built in the Daijiahu area. Over the past 50 years, Daijiahu Lake became a landfill for fly ash discharged from the thermal power plants. It then evolved from a fly ash dumpsite to a black hill more than 10 meters high, becoming the main polluting source of dust groundwater.<b>What is the project? </b><b>What are the CO2 reduction goals?</b>More than 30,000 trees and shrubs were planted in Daijiahu Park, with a greening rate of 91.8%. It provides more than 80 hectares of public green space, which is called a “green lung” in the East Gate of Wuhan. According to IPCC (2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Vol.4 AFOLU), the net growth value of aboveground biomass in subtropical grassland is 6 tons of dry matter/ha/year and the dry matter carbon ratio (CF) is 0.47 tons of carbon/ton dry matter. It is calculated that this project can increase carbon sink by 827.2 tons per year.Additionally, this project aims to solve the problem of serious dust pollution in Daijiahu Lake. The park can absorb 827 tons of carbon dioxide and more than 200 tons of dust every year.

Extreme weather events are occurring more frequently, and the impacts of these events are more dramatic than before. Heavy downpours can cause unexpected surface (pluvial) flooding when urban drainage and rivers systems can no longer cope with extreme water volumes. It is essential to understand and quantify these risks, in order to be able to plan, implement and manage flood resilient activities – from infrastructure and development, to the daily running of lives and businesses.<b>What is the innovation? How does it work?</b>
As a city in the Dutch Delta, Rotterdam is a front runner and worldwide leader in the area of water management and has an ambitious strategy for city resilience. Johan Verlinde, Programme Manager of the Rotterdam Water Delta Plan said: “Our city is vulnerable. Doing nothing is not an option. BlueLabel enables us to communicate with private individuals and companies, and to actively involve them. Smart, digital solutions such as BlueLabel help Rotterdam to become even more climate-proof. That makes it more attractive to live and work in our city.”At the moment 12 % of the buildings in Rotterdam have a risk of flooding based on BlueLabel. By 2022, this will be reduced to 10 %.By using labels (A-E), BlueLabel provides insight which is easy to interpret, also by non-experts. This way BlueLabel can be used to create dialogue between stakeholders and citizens. This dialogue is essential as the challenges that climate change introduces are not for one organization to solve. BlueLabel allows authorities to monitor flood vulnerability patterns over a period of time, in order to make spatial and infrastructure planning more climate-proof and water-resilient. The service can be used to further responsible policy making, and develop new flood protection standards that are linked to a risk-based approach. In addition, river (fluvial) flooding and coastal flooding (storm surges), or any combination of these, can be considered where relevant depending on the local water system.<b>Links to further Information </b><a href="https://bluelabel.net/En/">https://bluelabel.net/En/</a>

Luthuli Avenue boasts a high number of electronic businesses and is often characterized by a high volumes of public service vehicles that contribute to urban traffic congestion, air pollution and noise pollution, which have been detrimental to the quality of Luthuli Avenue’s businesses. The conversion of the Avenue to a one way street will go a long way to decongest the city and direct traffic out of the central business district. The added benefit of improved air quality through the beautification and planting of trees will drive the push for cleaner air. Air quality monitors are also being installed in the street to collect data which will enhance monitoring capabilities of pollution levels. The cycling lanes and pedestrian walkways will improve urban mobility within the city.<b>What is the project? How does it work?</b>The project aims at decongesting the city through the conversion of a major thoroughfare to a one way street. The cycling lanes and the pedestrian walkways will encourage non-motorized forms of mobility, reduce vehicular emissions, and improve the air quality and health of citizens.The climate-proofed infrastructure will avert urban flooding occurrences, promote cool cities and enhance climate change resilience. The air quality monitoring will provide the evidence base to eventually create the first carbon neutral street in the region, signalling the potential of this project to lead towards a transformative impact on the fabric of the city. <b>What are the CO2 reduction goals?</b>The transport sector in Nairobi is one of the biggest emitters in the city. The project will reduce vehicle emissions in the project area by up to 50% thanks to the restrictions on cars and the new infrastructure for non-motorised transportation.The businesses in the vicinity will benefit from increased numbers of customers thanks to the accessibility of the street, the space to display their products as well as the conducive environment to operate in which will all lead to increased revenues for the City and the businesses<b>Next Steps</b>The project completion date is still unknown. Improvements will be made to install more AQ monitors to get the requisite data on the status of the air quality in the project area. Additional mechanisms will be put in place to improve on service delivery and mobility.Image retrieved from

The hope is that the policy will increase the supply of smaller units in well located parts of the City, helping to address the housing backlog, bringing down prices of housing over time, as well as reducing travel times, costs and emissions in a city where these criteria are too high.<b>What is the innovation? How does it work</b>The framework will serve as a mechanism for land value capture that will favour the city and its residents. Council mandated to administer and award development rights within the city. The awarding of such rights usually results in an increase in value which should not only be enjoyed by the property owner, but should benefit the wider city and its residents as per the principles of the Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act.The project was innovative thanks to a detailed inclusionary housing calculator that was developed internally by the city. Creating a more compact city (as opposed to continuing with sprawl) will help to preserve the remaining natural and biodiverse areas we have in the outskirts of the city, maintaining the ecosystem services they provide.A compact city is environmentally and economically sustainable. It increases density and proximity which leads to a reduced energy consumption for transportation as well as improve land use management and preservation of rural land and biodiversity. A city with medium to high-density settlements has also reduced costs of services, public facilities and infrastructure provision, increasing economic sustainability and feasibility.<b>Next Steps</b>The policy (or similar policies) may be implemented by other Cities or indeed by National or Provincial Government.

Offering more efficient treatment and wider service coverage, the project is designed to effectively reduce adverse environmental impacts while promoting economic efficiency. Promulgated by the government, waste classification policies in Guangzhou have gained significant progresses so far, with classified kitchen waste (food and beverage industry) and resource recovery increasing to 1,000 tons/day and 7,500 tons/day respectively. Domestic waste is primarily disposed in two landfill sites: Xingfeng Landfill Site (since 2002) and Xingfeng Emergency Landfill Site (since 2018, 10,000 tons/day). Since 2018, a subproject on biogas treatment has been launched with an average biogas production of 26,280,000 Nm3/a, of which 52-55% is methane.<b>What is the project?</b>The landfill project covers an area of 917,000 square meters, with a design capacity of 38 million cubic meters. Its waste disposal can be as high as 10,000 tons/day, with a filling height of over 90 meters. Currently, this landfill is one of the largest landfills for domestic waste in China. A waste-to-energy plant project is the most difficult considering its construction, and the first case in China was built near a high fill slope with a height of 60 meters.<b>What are the CO2 reduction goals?</b>Firstly, being part of public infrastructures, Guangzhou’s solid waste disposal project helps urban economic development by making full use of waste generated in the city. Secondly, apart from dealing with waste, a reasonable profit is made through biogas power generation, thus reducing waste disposal costs and helping to realize cost recovery.Guangzhou's waste initiative is not a stand-alone initiative. It goes hand-in-hand with other initiatives on air quality control, public transport (electric buses), land-use planning and green space as part of an emerging systems approach to sustainable urban development. Such an approach is necessary as focusing on any one sector to the detriment of others would be counter-productive in the final analysis.With the rapid development of China's economy and the rapid growth of urban population, the problems of solid waste faced by cities are becoming more and more serious. According to relevant surveys, one third of China's cities are facing the dilemma of “Waste Siege”. Untreated waste is one of the main sources of environmental pollution, which will directly affect people's health and living environment. The Third Resource Thermal Power Station is equipped with 6 independently developed incinerators. The plant has a daily disposal capacity is 4,000 tons of waste, and the annual power generation is 5.28 million KWh. This project has contributed to the zero-buried solid waste in Guangzhou, progressing towards the three goals of ‘harmlessness’,‘minimization’and ‘recovery’.This initiative, together with previously mentioned initiatives on air quality and public transport is designed to maximize social benefits for all of Guangzhou's inhabitants. This is also the only way forward, namely to “leave no one behind” and to ensure that social, economic and environmental benefits are equally shared by all.Guangzhou is dedicated to offering environmental education for everyone in society and has welcomed more than 60,000 visitors. This will aid the public to acknowledge waste disposal, promote a green lifestyle and to develop the city in a sustainable manner.<b>Next Steps</b>There are 6 districts in center areas of Guangzhou and 4 districts in suburban areas. Those suburban areas are currently learning from the central city, and have begun constructing their own landfills and conducting incineration projects for solid waste disposal.

By 2019, Guadelajara has integrated 419.39 extra hectares into the project, encapsulating some of the most emblematic parks in the metropolis.<b>What is the innovation?</b>The main objective of this project is to manage these spaces with the same integral scheme of rehabilitation, care and maintenance of urban ecosystems with an inclusive and broad-spectrum social perspective and to consolidate urban forests as integral social and environmental welfare centers. When retrieving spaces with approved criteria, the city then offers a service with periodic management that includes the increase of the forest mass in good state of health, with the corresponding attention to the native biodiversity, as well as to generate safe and pleasant spaces for the healthy cohabitation of the inhabitants and visitors of the city.<b>What are the CO2 reduction goals?</b>The project seeks to reduce the city’s overall CO2 production through the increase of green areas and ensuring connectivity between urban forestsUrban forests also serve as buffers in the growing effect of climate change. In the most forested areas, the city observed a temperature of between 2 and 3 degrees less than in the more built urban environment. Increasing the greenery in a given area is crucial for the city to restore its usually benevolent climate.The environmental benefits will be reflected in the immediate attention of the health of soil, forestry, biodiversity and environmental services that the urban parks and forests of the metropolis, this benefit will be measurable later on.<b>Next Steps</b>The systemic conception of the environmental, architectural and social heritage that these green areas represent has demonstrated the undeniable relevance of working in a network for the care of the environment.The organisation working on the project is aiming for a new metropolitan approach , with the intention to create a “Metropolitan Urban Forestry Agency”, with the strategy of optimizing resources, knowledge, technology and strategic alliances with the aim of guaranteeing a sustainable future for the inhabitants of Guadalajara.

The installation of the first Hydroelectric Energy Generator (CGH), in the Barigui Park, is set to produce clean energy without damaging the environment. This is thanks to the energy efficiency program of Curitiba City Hall, which also encompasses new legislation that allows the use of public spaces to produce renewable energy. The project was accompanied by an environmental impact assessment, concluding that there is no change on the lake’s flow rate nor issues for the animals. The hydroelectric energy reduces the necessity of using thermoelectric plants, which corresponds to 14% of the Brazilian energy matrix. This will thus reduce CO2e emissions, and contribute to the municipal resources savings. The project encompasses multiple actions, providing a landscape structure around the CGH to disclose environmental and educational actions to the benefit of the population, nurturing awareness about clean energy, and to the preservation of the environment and actions to tackle climate change. <b>What is the project? How does it work?</b>It is the first Hydroelectric Power Plant of Curitiba, with a potential to generate 30Kw of electricity, and the first to utilize the Archimedes' screw principle, the mechanism of helical thread, in an urban environment.It is a project that encompasses environmental protection, flood management, production of clean energy and environmental awareness.<b>What are the CO2 reduction goals?</b>Climate change is already causing an impact on the city, mainly in the occurrence of heavy storms, cloud bursts and flooding. The CGH has the objective to reduce the city’s GHG emissions, producing clean energy taking advantage of the existing lakes while preserving their biodiversity and reducing neighbouring population vulnerability.<b>Next Steps</b>The project is first being implanted in Bairgui Park, a popular site for visitors. There are currently two more in development.The Hydroelectric Energy Generator Plan in Barigui park has the potential to generate 30Kw. The CGH in São Lourenço Park has the potential of more 30Kw while the Lago Azul Park of another 1Kw. By the end of 2020, the generation started in July 2019 will be at least duplicated.

Together with several partners, the initiative introduces a new paradigm on how to manage water resources in an urban environment.Appropriately redirecting sewage for treatment is a challenge, not only because of the population's unawareness of its importance, but also because the city must create a bold framework that efficiently identifies and correct issues of existing systems.Focusing the work of the project to one sub-basin at a time, the project considers each region’s specificities and needs to direct actions and investments seeking the preservation of water springs and supply.Besides major civil works involving drainage, containment, profiling, and the dredging of rivers and lakes, the plan highlights the importance of local public committees to inspect the project's progress and continuity.Regarding the sewage collection system, the programme encapsulates the implementation and remodelling of treatment plants, the inspections of properties' connections to the system, marketing campaigns, the usage of low impact development technologies and the creation of a system to manage water resources, among others.<b>What is the innovation? How does it work?</b>This work is directed in sub-basins, with big collective actions that gather all teams in one place. All rivers in Curitiba flow from north to south, so the project will start from the north side of the city and will work its way down to its southern edge. This is a collective work, composed from many secretariats, state bodies and federal bodies.Since the beginning of the programme, 76% of the 449,699 connections (property of the sewage network) in Curitiba have been inspected. From this sample, 90,374 were considered irregular for disposing waste directly into rivers or rainwater tunnels.The programme's main goal is to reduce water shortage risks, especially with the preservation of water springs that supply the city. For that, it sets its priorities as thus: water quality improvement, citizenship education, industrial and residential residues and effluents' control, as well as proper treatment for those. Also, the “Amigos dos Rios” promotes recuperation and arborization of permanent preservation areas.Thanks to this programme, the risk of mosquito-born diseases has gone down. There has also been an improvement on the quality of life for citizens who live by the river’s edge, thanks to to the improvements done on the urban environment and the beautification of the area. For these communities, the clean river may also prove itself as a source of local pride.The preservation of rivers and water basins, including the promotion of awareness and clean-up campaigns, maintains the quality of the natural resources that the city can benefit from. Thanks to this project, the city is able to implement sustainable development as a policy and maintain its economic prosperity.<b>Next Steps</b>This project can inspire other cities by showing the example that large-scale projects on water management are possible in times of economic crisis. It also shows that such structural reforms on the city’s natural resources policies can be possible with, above all, political will.

The program’s aim is to highlight the importance and benefits of the the ecosystem services provided by bees. Through their pollination services, native bees are responsible for 40% to 90% of the perpetuation of native woods in Brazil as well for at least 33% of food plantations in the region. Hence, the program was conceived with the dual purpose of conserving the bee population in Curitiba for its added benefits to biodiversity and to the productivity of the Urban Farm program in the city.The program achieves this through a two-pronged approach:The first is by raising ecological awareness to the conservation and maintenance of urban biodiversity and its impact on quality of life to citizens. It is doing this through interacting with the media, experts and city managers to demonstrate how important bees are to the region’s wealth and biodiversity. Notably, it launched a series of courses called the Secondly, it introduces a set of management measures to protect native pollinators. The project ensures that all the new biodiversity projects in Curitiba are developed with the conservation of the bees as a fundamental element in the quality of life, air, water, food and of the city. <b>What is the policy? </b>Bees are responsible for the perpetuation of plant species, as well as the feed supply for animals and seeds dispersion. One of the goals of this project is to increase fruit and seeds production, accelerating and strengthening the restoration of degraded areas as a strategy to mitigate climate change. Additionally, the project is aiming to create a series of ecological corridors called ‘pollen corridors’ to help create a purifying effect on the air in the city and to increase the quality of life of its citizens. The program also hopes to raise awareness of the importance of Ecosystem Services and expand the culture of environmental responsibility. Brazil has between 300 and 400 bee species identified, and is highly dependent on them for its natural habitat. Many are the stingless native bees natives of Parana State:Jataí (Tetragonisca angustula), species that has useful characteristics for rational exploitation, with excellent honey, good productivity and docility; Mandaçaia (Melipona quadrifasciata), a rare species in nature; Mirins (Plebeia spp.), small bees, whose variety of species and relative ease in choosing nesting sites make it the most common group in the State; Tubuna (Scaptotrigona bipunctata), an aggressive species that produces abundant honey.  Irapuá (Trigona spinipes), even more aggressive than the Tubuna, and it does not adapt to the hive rearing because its nest is arboreal and its honey is not suitable to consumption due to the habit of the bees to visit waste and decaying carcasses. One of the most interesting species in the State from a behavioural point of view is the Irati (Lestrimelitta limao), whose main characteristic is the inability to remove from the flowers the necessary pollen and nectar for their subsistence. Due to this, this species steals the material needed for the nest and for its subsistence from other meliponini (stingless bees), a habit known scientifically as kleptobiosis (SCHWARTZ, 1995). The list of endangered species in Parana State includes 18 bees species, being 8 solitaries and 10 socials (SCHWARTZ-FILHO et al. 2004).<b>Next Steps</b>Projects such as the Honey Gardens are needed in practically every city in similar climates. The States of Pará, Goiás, Santa Catarina, in Brazil, and the countries of Paraguay, Costa Rica and Malaysia have shown interest in replicating the Honey Gardens program. The loss of pollinator bees in the world have highlighted the necessity to implement initiatives that promote the conservation of bees and, consequently, the conservation of the fauna and flora of the planet. Curitiba is open to sharing the knowledge and the guidelines of the project.

Due to a lack of financial and technical resources, the municipal body of Karachi struggles to manage solid waste in a safe and sustainable way. This raises the important issue of how to deliver quality service in the face of financial and skill constraints in the public sector. To overcome the problems related to solid waste management, the City District Government of Karachi (now defunct) carried out a study which showed that approximately 9,000 tones of solid waste was generated in Karachi daily. However, rapid establishment of new housing sectors and industrial estates, construction activity and a variety of institutions have over the years contributed to waste generation. The amount of solid wastes has substantially increased to 14,000/16,000 tons per day, aided by the rapid growth of population and economic activity. It is estimated that by the year 2020, the solid waste generation may approach 18,000 to 20,000 tons each day. The current poor solid waste management practices demand a mechanism for efficient solid waste management. Lack of planning, inappropriate technology and poor management are obviously the main areas of concern and require a serious effort from government authorities and other agencies to achieve efficiency in the management of solid waste.  The objectives of the study conducted by UNESCAP include the following: To accomplish the objectives of the study, two parts were designed. First, a questionnaire survey for households and the commercial and market chain was conducted. The second part comprised of the collection and analysis of solid waste produced by households and commercial activities, including vegetable & fruit markets. Recommendations based on the survey and analysis conducted as a part of the study include the following.<b>Next Steps</b>The Government of Sindh, in consultation with the Solid Waste Management Board, is expected to take up the recommendations for implementation in a phased manner and set aside funds for this initiative. <b>Links to further Information </b><a href="https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/SWM-COMPLETE%20REPORT%20KARACHI%20%20%2012-Mar-13.pdf">UN ESCAP Baseline Study for Solid Waste Management – Karachi</a><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334361518_Urban_Solid_Waste_Management_in_Karachi_Pakistan">Researchgate – Urban Solid Waste Management in Karachi, Pakistan</a><b>Contact Details</b><i>Muhammad Maswood Alam<br/>

The park features walkways, cycle tracks, an indoor & outdoor gymnasium, children playing zones, a women’s corner, a library, kiosks, and landscaped gardens. The park is gifted with a water body which is accessible by waterside walkways. A green amphitheatre, a performance deck, suspended viewing decks and a drinking water fountain are special attractions that provide the area with natural beauty. Landscaping with grass, plants, flower beds, rain water harvesting facilities have been kept. Two gateways, peripheral visible fencing, lighting and security systems have been incorporated for accessibility and safety. A water fountain, public toilet facilities and trash bins are kept for public convenience.<b>Next Steps</b>The city will develop the guidelines for the operations and maintenance of parks, playgrounds and open spaces and involve the neighbourhood community in the planning and operation through partnerships. The supervision and monitoring of the establishment will be done through a co-management system involving the Dhaka North City Corporation and the community.

There has been a constant increase in the number of registered two-wheelers and cars in Jaipur. The growth percentage of cars has outpaced the growth percentage of two-wheelers and there is an urgent need to regulate parking, both on-street and off-street. Given the lack of space to provide additional parking and the extreme heat conditions that are prevalent in the city during the summer season, there is an opportunity to look at parking management as a tool to introduce green spaces on the streets, helping to reduce the urban heat island effect.One of the consequences of the urbanization is the urgent need to find a way to deal with parking in the city. With no space to widen the roads, the city is dealing with an acute shortage of space to provide vehicular parking.Parking space has become an indispensible requirement in the city, which is undergoing a constant increase in the number of vehicles. With the increasing traffic volume on prime roads in the walled city and outer areas of Jaipur, available parking spaces are fast being outnumbered by the demand. In the absence of available parking spaces, people tend to halt their vehicles, especially cars and auto-rickshaws, on the carriage way waiting for their co-riders to finish their work and return. This in turn, proves obstruction to the already slow moving traffic. Also, the availability of space and cost of infrastructure for building new parking spaces are two important factors to be considered while developing the new parking spaces in the city.In order to overcome the limitation of these two factors and parking problems, Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) decided to develop, through PPP funding, a multilevel parking covering a storm water drain at Ashok Nagar. The covering of this storm water drain has also promoted the beautification of the area through improved aesthetics.  <b>What is the project?</b><b>Major components of the project</b>The project has been developed on a ‘Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer’ (DBFOT) basis (PPP Model). The entire development expenses have been borne by the developer. The operation and maintenance period of the parking facility is of 30 years. Total premium payable to Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) is Rs. 11,903,500 (ca. $170,000 USD) during the contract period. As a consequence of this project, approximately 40,000 Sq.ft of parking space has been diverted from the street, resulting in the creation of green areas which in turn will add to tackling the urban heat island effect in the city during the summer season. <b>Next Steps</b>The Jaipur Municipal Corporation is in consultation with the State Government of Rajasthan and is expected to take up the recommendations for scaling up the implementation across the city in a phased manner and set aside funds for this initiative. <b>Contact Details</b><b><i>Mr. Anil Singhal</i></b><i>Chief Enginner</i><i>Email: “ce.jmc@rajasthan.gov.in”</i><i>Tel: +91 95717 82111</i>

The project aims to replace all conventional street lights under JNN jurisdiction with high efficacy LEDs. The JNN LED-based Energy Saving Project is rated by IFC (International Finance Corporation) as one of the largest ESCO (Energy Service Company) projects based on actual savings.Its uniqueness lies in the fact that it is an environmentally-friendly implementation as it contains no lead, no mercury or any poisonous gas.Apart from energy savings and providing better public illumination and road safety, this project comes without any capital expenditure to the state governemnt and JNN. These savings can hence be utilised for other important projects, for example, illuminating rural areas.<b>What is the project? </b><b>Major components of the project</b>To implement this energy saving project, the Government of Rajasthan signed on January 23, 2015, an MoU with Energy Efficiency Services Limited New Delhi (EESL).<b>The following are the objectives of the project:</b><b>The following were some of the challenges that the project needed to address:</b><b>Solution</b>Based on an initial baseline energy audit and power consumption pattern, the project replaced existing conventional fixtures consuming 48 to 550 Watt of energy with LED fixtures 5 to 112 Watt to provide better illumination and higher energy savings. This has ensured achievement of ca. 77% energy savings compared to the baseline data.The introduction of CCMS has led to increased accountability and made the process of identifying failures accurate and fast, thereby reducing the turnaround time of repairs and maintenance. The results are thus:<b>Cost effectiveness</b><b>Next Steps</b>Jaipur is currently in the process of building its city-wide Green House Gas Inventory in collaboration with UNIDO and the carbon reduction as a result of the LED street light transition is being quantified and will be made available shortly.<strong>Contact</strong><b><i>Mr. Anil Singhal</i></b><i>Chief Enginner</i><i>Email: “ce.jmc@rajasthan.gov.in”</i><i>Tel: +91 95717 82111</i>

It has the potential of lowering the state’s expenditure on energy, strengthening its energy security, and reducing its reliance on unsustainable fossil fuels. To attain this potential, rapid capacity addition in solar power is needed. Hence, it is deemed necessary to have a Delhi Solar Energy Policy for the promotion of solar power plants. The following Delhi Solar Energy Policy is for the period 2016-2020. It’s being monitored annually based on actual performance, market conditions, and consumer experience.In 2014, the peak power demand in Delhi was almost 6000 MW and the total annual consumption in 2014-15 was 27,266 million kWh. Power demand can vary considerably across a 24-hour window, especially in summers, owing to the increasing use of air conditioning. In general, energy utilities (DISCOMS) pay more to meet short-term demand surges, raising the average cost of power. Delhi’s daily day time peak demand curve broadly matches the generation curve of solar system, which can therefore help to reduce peak demands. Moreover, the energy produced by rooftop solar systems is mostly consumed at, or near, the point of generation, minimizing transmission and distribution losses. Self-consumption of rooftop solar energy also reduces the need for, and the challenge of, provisioning new distribution infrastructure, such as transformers, in congested localities.Rooftop solar systems offer sustainable energy, environmental benefits, low gestation period, low transmission and distribution losses, reduced need for distribution infrastructure, and peak load offset that reduces costs for DISCOMS and ultimately for the consumers as well. Market conditions are also more favourable for solar power than before. While solar energy tariffs have, on average, fallen 6-8% per year since 1998, solar panel prices have dropped 75% in the last six years and conventional energy tariffs risen 6.9% per year on average since 2007. After years of innovation and declining prices, solar energy tariffs in Delhi have become so much cheaper than conventional energy that subsidies from the State of Delhi are deemed not necessary. However, a generation-based Incentive for a limited period seems prudent to promote adoption in the domestic segment.The Government of India has set a target of 100 GW (100000 MW) of solar energy generation in India by the year 2022, of which 40 GW (40000 MW) is from rooftops. Delhi is well positioned to lead India’s rooftop solar revolution and it has consequently established solar generation targets of 1GW (1000 MW) by 2020 (4.2% of energy consumed) and 2.0 GW (2000 MW) by 2025 (6.6% of energy consumed). To help achieve these targets, GNCTD aims to raise consumer awareness of solar energy, promote capacity building, and generate healthy competition among solar developers, so that solar power is adopted on a mass scale.<b>What are the CO2 reduction achievements?</b>2016’s Delhi Solar Energy Policy has the following ten broad objectives: i. Reduce Delhi’s reliance on conventional energy while increasing its energy security and lowering average energy prices in the long term. Promote rapid growth of rooftop solar power via a combination of generation targets, regulations, mandates and incentives. ii. Encourage market-based approaches and public-private partnerships to drive demand and adoption, with minimal use of State Government subsidies. Develop initiatives to raise public awareness of solar energy in Delhi. iii. Ensure fairness for all stakeholders in the solar ecosystem, including roof top owners, DISCOMS, investors, consumers of non-solar power, technology and services providers. iv. Use regulatory mechanisms to drive demand and adoption, such as mandating solar plant deployments on government rooftops, requiring in-state solar RPO targets for DISCOMS, modifying building bylaws to facilitate solar plant deployment, specifying responsibilities for the inspection/certification of solar plants, aggregating demand for solar projects, and more. v. Promote net metering / gross metering and grid connectivity for all solar plants by simplifying and streamlining processes and methods. vi. Generate employment in the solar energy sector through skill development especially for youth. Establish core technical competence of professionals in the NCT of Delhi to initiate and sustain effective management of solar projects and infrastructure. vii. Provide generation-based Incentives for the domestic segment where solar power costs are yet to achieve parity for most users, as well as tax exemptions and waivers for all consumers. viii. Promote a robust investment climate that enables multiple financial models, from self-owned (CAPEX) to third-party owned (RESCO) models. Also facilitate access to loans at preferential interest rates through various schemes that may be introduced from time to time, whether through public or private channels. ix. Establish policy implementation, monitoring and compliance framework to make sure that efficient execution and periodic review of the policy takes place. x. Develop solar energy as part of an overall strategy of providing affordable, reliable, 24/7 power to all citizens, incorporating demand side management, energy conservation, energy efficiency initiatives, quality assurance and longevity of projects, distributed renewable energy generation, and smart grid development.<strong>Links to Further Information</strong><a href="https://www.c40.org/wp-content/static/other_uploads/images/2495_DelhiSolarPolicy.original.pdf?1577986979">Delhi Solar Energy Policy (2016)</a>Image retrieved from

The wetland ecosystem includes plants such as typha latifolia and spider lily, a layer of gravel which filters water, and has a biofilm on it to process pollutants. The gravel system also immobilises heavy metals.Constructed wetlands are effective in treating organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, decreasing the concentrations of trace metals and organic chemicals (Kadlec and Knight 1996). The submerged aquatic macrophytes have very thin cuticles and therefore, readily take up metals from water through the entire surface. Macrophytes possess extraordinary ability to survive the adverse conditions of pollution and possess high colonization rate that are virtual tools of excellence for phytoremediation. Further they redistribute metals from sediments to water, finally accumulate in the plant tissues, accelerate biogeochemical processes and hence maintain homoeostasis.<b>How does the system work?</b>Step 1 – Raw sewage from all channels tapped to meet at common inlet. Water quality at input level is BOD 150, TDS 2,214Step 2 – Sewage fed into underground sedimentation tank and bio-digester: Solid components broken down and decomposed, big particles are then removed. BOD is 75.Step 3 – Solar pumps push output to artificial wetland: 2.5m deep gravel with hormonally treated plants absorb toxins. BOD is 20.Step 4 – Treated water passes along slope of grassland to waterbody. Carbon and sand filters reduce BOD/TDS level to below 10/10. <b>Next Steps</b>This model will be used to revive 159 lakes at a cost of INR 376 crore (ca.

Bus services are historically considered unpredictable, unstable and uncomfortable. People who can use other transport modes, usually prefer motorcycle, rickshaw and taxi rather than buses. Hence, Karachi has been looking for ways to invest in two new BRT lines.The Karachi Transportation Improvement Project (KTIP) was conducted from April 2010 to June 2012 by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in collaboration with the Karachi Mass Transit Cell (KMTC) and the City District Government of Karachi (CDGK).KTIP consisted of a master plan and a feasibility study. In the master plan study, the JICA Study Team proposed a circular railway (composed of 2 railway systems) and 6 BRT corridors. Each corridor has been given a name of color for better legibility. After the master plan stage, JICA selected 2 BRT corridors, namely Green Line and Red Line, to be assessed in the feasibility study.The feasibility study was conducted from July 2011 to June 2012 resulting in the proposal of 2 dedicated bus lanes in the median strips along M.A. Jinnah Road – Gurmandir – Lasbela – A.O. Clock – Surjani (Green Line) and Regal Chowk – People’s Roundabout – University Road – Model Colony (Red Line), with 57 stations.<strong>Private Sector Involvement</strong>In Pakistan, there are currently only a few cases of large investments in the transport sector by the private sector. The largest one in the country today is for high-speed railways, PKR 225 million. Karachi’s BRT would need PKR 5.1 billion for vehicle acquisition alone, which makes the necessary investment more than 20 times bigger than what was needed for the high-speed railway.BRT is also a completely new approach for Karachi, and it seems unrealistic that the private sector would be confident to invest a huge amount of capital for it. Hence, Karachi opened up to the possibility of accepting investments from a foreign private operator or creating a joint venture with local companies.<strong>Equity Investment </strong>In the case of the Karachi Circular Railway development, the equity investment was planned as only 3.7% of the total investment cost. Most portion of the project was planned to be covered by foreign loans. The total cost of the project was estimated to be as large as PKR 160 billion with the equity investment estimated to be PKR 5.9 billion only.The total investment cost of the BRT system, instead, is estimated to be PKR 17.2 billion (USD 111,260,000). The Study Team considers that the equity investment could be as high as PKR 3.4 billion, which is equivalent to 20% of the total investment.<strong>Loans</strong>Two types of loans were considered. One with JICA, a very soft and long-term loan with a low-interest rate, and the other one, a short term loan with higher interest rates, available in the domestic market to cope with potential money shortages.<strong>Links to further information</strong>“

These measure have been implemented through Resolution 341 / APrA / 2016, Law 3147 and The new laws surrounding the use of plastic straws led to a reduced generation of 77 tons of waste per year of material that does not have a recycling market. This material can also easily escape waste management systems, reach the river and consequently damage flora and aquatic fauna. Only 5% of discarded bags are effectively recycled, while in the case of plastic straws that share drops to zero. This political action also led to 1 billion less bags in circulation between 2017 and 2018, equivalent to 2,750 tons per year. <b>GHG emissions reduction: </b><b>Climate </b><b>Next Steps</b>In the future, the aim is to set-up an even more ambitious standard that allows the prohibition to be extended to other single-use plastics.

The essence of adaptive leadership is to promote adaptability that allows the organization to flourish and learn from past experiences in order to guide future successes.  Cape Town's The first module is a simulation exercise of a heatwave scenario, aiming to:  During the simulation exercise, staff members are assigned roles at random and are then presented with various elements of information through mock news headlines as the heat wave escalates. The heat wave simulation provides a unique learning opportunity to apply adaptive leadership skills in practice. The adaptive leadership model is designed to assist organisations and individuals in dealing with significant and disruptive changes in uncertain times where no set procedures or clear guidelines exist. Adaptive leaders make use of practices and strategies that assist in accomplishing change and developing the adaptability required to thrive in challenging and complex environments.  The Adaptive Leadership training programme puts emphasis on the capabilities of people to respond to uncertainty. It is not aiming to produce exact responses to specific climate shocks, but rather build the broad range of skills needed to respond to any event on any scale.<b>Next Steps</b>At present, the City of Cape Town held two simulation exercises and two masterclasses which have helped to refine the project. During this time 100 staff members have been trained. The plan is to scale the project to reach at least four simulations and eight masterclasses per year, with an estimated 50 staff members attending each simulation exercise and 25 each masterclass. Over the next 5 years, the City of Cape Town aims to train 1,000 city staff members.

Certain implementations of the renovation, such as the delivery room, are part of GrowSmarter and thus supported by EU-funding through the Horizon 2020 initiative. The parcels are transported to the delivery room using e-cargo bikes. Couriers and residents access the delivery room using a smartphone app/electronic key, which controls entry to the room, restricting it only to those with a package to collect. This GrowSmarter Sustainable Delivery project makes delivery more convenient for tenants, as they can pick up their goods at any time during the day and are not required to travel to a nearby delivery point to pick up their goods. The delivery of wide range of parcels (e.g. furniture) is possible, as the full space of the room can be used for storage. This service improves residents’ accessibility to postal services whilst reducing delivery traffic. Throught this concept, unused space in residential buildings can be transformed to provide an important service for residents. 
By using electric assisted bicycles for the delivery of the goods to the delivery room, the project reduces CO2 emissions since the goods otherwise would have been distributed by a truck or car. As a result, this reduced need for conventional delivery vehicles frees up street space for bicycles and pedestrians. By decreasing the volume of fossil fuel vehicles in the area, especially heavy vehicles, CO2 emissions will be reduced by an estimated 60 %. The goal is a 100 % decrease of fossil fuel delivery vehicles to the area.Apart from the delivery room with fossil fuel free delivery system per se, a number of other mobility measures were connected to the refurbishment of the buildings, such as electric car, e-bike and e-cargo bike charging and parking infrastructure. These will help residents reduce their use of fossil fuel vehicles and hence decrease air pollution.<b>Next Steps</b>The City of Stockholm and partners are delivering a series of reports as  policy recommendations to local decision-makers, covering  the technical, social and economic validation of the project as well as its potential to be replicated. They are also arranging study visits and workshops at the pilot site, where many international delegations have participated in order to understand the replicability of the measures in their cities. In addition, the The potential for adaptation and further improvements to this climate action measure is high. Additional functions can be added, such as delivering refrigerated goods or responding to other residents’ serviced demand, such as sharing cycles, ladders, machine tools or other items. A wide range of cities and other stakeholders have shown interest in replicating this measure, including PostNord, the postal service of Denmark and Sweden. The project partners and app provider have also developed related services using a similar approach, including unmanned “delivery containers” for use at construction sites.

In twelve years, the whole fleet of transport means will be only composed of electric vehicles, including 1,200 electric buses, serving both the city and the metropolitan area. These will be supported by 83 electric service cars for assisting transports, monitoring operations and maintaining subway and tram centers. Moreover, three full electric hubs will be built and four existing bus depots will be progressively transformed to host the new buses, through the installation of smart electric recharge points. To ensure that the system is 100% electric, ATM has also moved to a new electricity provider exclusively supplying certified renewable energy.  These measures to create green and healthy streets are in-line with many of the commitments undertaken by the municipality, which include the <b>What is the policy?</b>Several innovative smart sustainable technologies will be deployed as part of the public transport network electrification.The bus depots feature: The Quick Charge terminus grappled initially with the challenge of having a high power available in distributed locations. The solution found involved connecting the battery chargers directly to direct current overhead power supply or to the metro medium-voltage subway cabins, Thus the charge terminus features:<b>What are the CO2 reduction goals and achievements?</b><b>CO2 Reduction: </b>This final goal will be achieved through an intermediary step, thanks to the purchase of 215 electric buses and 295 hybrid buses by the end of 2022. By then, the reduction in diesel consumption will be of 6.5 million litres/year, corresponding to a decrease in carbon emissions of 16,000 tons/year. The new contract for the supply of electric power produced 100% from renewable sources will save 100,000 tons of CO2 emissions yearly.<b>Air Quality: </b><b>Next Steps</b>When finished, this electrification project will cover 100% of the bus fleet and it will upgrade all the existing bus depots.

Arden will advance Melbourne's strengths as a progressive, innovative and connected local and global city. The new North Melbourne underground station will catalyse Arden's transformation and public transport connectivity, helping to make Arden an exemplar of sustainable urban renewal. <b>What is the project? </b>The project is looking to draw upon unique precedents at an international scale that will help define exemplar sustainable urban renewal. This includes net zero emissions for energy, waste and transport, 100% renewable energy targets, blue and green infrastructure which celebrates water in the landscape to foster good levels of green infrastructure across the private and public realm to keep Arden healthy and cool. The community and built form within the precinct will aspire to meet the highest attainable star ratings available, using Green Star tools (or equivalent) which will be underpinned by strong governance to ensure continual operational reporting frameworks align to the Arden Vision.The mix of private and public land ownership and the opportunity to drive a high level of sustainable change through this mechanism makes the precinct unique at a local scale. Other significant urban renewal areas have a mix that is much lower and therefore it is harder to drive significant sustainable change especially in private land areas where the planning scheme is the only effective mechanism available to drive targeted outcomes. In the Arden precinct, contractual arrangements for the sale or long term lease of public land parcels will allow for strong sustainability incentives such as procuring carbon positive developments.  <b>What are the CO2 reduction goals and achievements?</b><b>CO2 Reduction: </b><b>Resilience: </b><b>Air Quality: </b><b>Next Steps</b>The project has a geographic boundary –  however the problems, challenges and resulting ideas for the precinct are aligned to other urban renewal areas within the municipality where precedents can be adapted and replicated to work in parallel precincts.Image retrieved from

Similar to other older buildings, these had problems with thermal bridges and climate shell insulation. A significant amount of heat and energy was lost in the existing energy installations in these buildings, due to long distances of poorly insulated pipes for heating and water, as well as the absence of heat recovery systems. The climate shell refurbishment consisted of a package of innovative technologies:  <b>Smart visualisation</b>In addition to the above innovative technologies implemented, the project also equipped several apartments with smart home energy visualization applications in the form of a screen connected to smart plugs, to monitor energy consumption in real-time. This raised the tenants’ awareness of their own energy consumption, aiming to encourage a more sustainable way of life.<b>Financing</b>The renovation was made by the housing company Stockholmshem, a private company partially owned by the City of Stockholm, who are the owners of the apartment blocks in question. Stockholmshem took on most of the costs., while certain sections of the renovation, such as the climate shell refurbishment were part of GrowSmarter and thus supported by EU-funding through the Horizon 2020 Initiative.<b>What are the CO2 reduction goals and achievements?</b><b>CO2 Reductions: </b>The baseline for heating, cooling and electric energy has been obtained through measurement of annual energy demand (kWh/m2) corrected for ambient conditions before measures have been implemented. The annual performance is displayed as energy signatures, highlighting any difference between the two scenarios. The emissions data source is established from official authorities and used throughout the evaluation period of baseline and evaluation of conducted measures. The consumed energy mix has been established and used throughout the evaluation period of baseline and evaluation of conducted measures.

This pilot project sets a good example for other locations, as it includes systems for district heating for five of the buildings, but also a system for geothermal heating for one of them. These systems can also be used for cooling.

PM Monitoring Supports Air Quality Improvement in Moscow

Improving ambient air quality is one of the greatest challenges the city faces today. There are many sources that discharge polluting compounds into the atmosphere, most of them anthropogenic. In addition to gaseous compounds, one of the most important pollutants is particulate matter (PM). Fine particulates are exceptionally dangerous for the health of Moscow residents. 2.5 µm particles can penetrate the alveolaris system and can remain there permanently. The Government of Moscow has identified the reduction of ambient PM in the air as one of their main environmental goals.Within the scope of this goal, the city government has developed a modern system for monitoring the PM-content in the atmosphere and keeping citizens and the municipality informed. The monitoring system includes automatic methods for measuring particulate matters (PM10 and PM2.5), as well as a unique method for determining the chemical composition (PAH and heavy metals), which helps identify the pollution sources. There are currently over 50 automatic air pollution monitoring stations in the city, including 32 stations equipped with instruments for PM measurement. This approach allows the municipality to identify and assess the impact of individual anthropogenic sources of PM. The city developed public information resources to inform citizens and policymakers about pollutants within the city, which has led to better decision-making. As a result, emissions from industry in Moscow have gone down by 13% in the past 5 years.  <b>What is the policy? </b>The automatic air pollution monitoing stations in Moscow also include automated dust sampling systems for fine particles. The first automatic weighing system with such function of temperature control and filter coding in Russia was put into operation in 2013. The city takes an interest in the composition of these particles, because health damage is not only caused by the mechanical particles, but also by chemical substances absorbed by these particulates. The monitoring system has helped identify pollution sources – such as sources of benzo(a)pyrene (which stems from the combustion process), copper and iron (from industrial sources of pollution), and calcium and aluminium (from the components of building mixtures).<b>CO2 reduction:</b><b>Air Quality:</b>According to the data of automatic control stations and real surveys of the city’s territory, the content of PM10 in the atmospheric air near the highways has decreased by 30% since 2015. This was achieved thanks to a systematic, purposeful city policy, which is based on air monitoring data of particulate matter.

It also continues to measure progress across key emissions areas, including buildings, vehicles, aircraft, and more. The CNS is a guidebook on how to accomplish quantifiable emissions reductions in today’s operations and to reach net carbon neutrality by 2021 by lowering its emissions to 50% of its 1990 baseline and purchasing offsets. The aim is for SFO to become the first carbon neutral, zero waste, and zero net energy airport in the world, to serve as a model for airports around the world.In 2018, SFO achieved a 39% reduction in GHG emissions, and launched new and industry-leading initiatives that included a sustainable aviation fuel logistics, supply chain, and financing program, to accelerate the airport’s alternative fuel transition. This innovative program is leading the aviation industry globally toward a sustainable fuel transition. SFO also boosted efforts to electrify third-party-owned ground support equipment on the airfield, in an effort to reduce emissions and improve the well-being of airfield workers; implemented a Zero Waste Plan; commissioned the first net-zero energy facility at an airport; and is acquiring six electric buses.<b>Scope 3 emissions addressed</b>SFO’s Climate Action Plan and Carbon Neutral Strategy is one of only a few, if not the only, airport carbon neutral strategy which incorporates sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as a key approach to reduce SFO’s emphasis on SAF as a key strategy necessary for reducing Scope 3 emissions is a major innovative element of the CNS. SFO’s efforts to organize a SAF Stakeholder Working Group (SWG) with over 100 active members, sign a voluntary MOU with 10 airlines and fuel producers, and initiate a study to identify and overcome the numerous barriers are groundbreaking in the industry. At most airports, new infrastructure is required to handle increased provision of sustainable aviation fuel, and SFO is leading the way on preparing for a sustainable aviation future. <b>Net-zero energy facilities</b>SFO is also one of the first airports in the U.S. to construct a net-zero energy facility (Airfield Operations) and plans to dramatically reduce energy intensity of buildings through coordinated net-zero projects. The CNS addresses challenges with designing decarbonized facilities in high-occupancy environments like an airport and pushes for developing a new, fully decarbonized central utilities plant, utilizing innovative technologies like heat pumps and thermal storage at large scale. <b>Zero Waste Plan</b>SFO is also among the first to adopt a <b>Project financing</b>The CNS itself was developed by staff who are paid through Airport operational funds, which derive from Airport revenues (City funds). The capital projects to reduce emissions that have been implemented to achieve emissions reductions, either as outlined in prior action plans or in the 2018 Carbon Neutral Strategy, are sourced either from the same operational funds, or as part of a larger bond-funded capital improvement program. The Airport reserved $100 million in a ZERO (Zero Energy & Resilient Outcomes) fund for energy efficiency measures across capital projects that exceed baseline energy code (<b>GHG emissions reduction and air quality improvement:</b><b>Climate Resilience: </b><b>Next Steps</b>SFO meets regularly with industry stakeholders through the Airports Council International (ACI), including its Airport Carbon Accreditation working group, to share key work products, challenges and opportunities for partnership. Here, SFO has presented its Carbon Neutral Strategy and is also actively serving on a variety of working groups to support others in drafting their own. SFO is also co-leading a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Task Group, under the ACI Sustainability Council, to convene both ‘leaders’ and ‘skeptics’ to define what an airport’s role is in accelerating SAF use. SFO also regularly presents its work at conferences and through working groups including active participation in the US Green Building Council (“LEED for Airports” rating system), CERES (Business Investing in Clean Energy Policy Committee), FAA ASCENT, (Center of Excellence for Alternative Jet Fuels and Environment) UN International Civil Aviation Organization (Greening Airports Forum, Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection, Conference on Aviation and Alternative Fuels), among others.

The mobile app evaluates the real-time personalised health risk of the user at his/her location, and if high, it alerts him/her and provides recommendations and routing instructions to the nearest cooling centres. The Dashboard provides information and tools to the authorities to manage the disaster: (1) next day alerts, (2) current hazard maps, and (3) an information management tool for the<b>What is the innovation/policy/project/technology? How does it work</b>EXTREMA uses real-time satellite data, along with other model and city-specific data to estimate the temperature, humidity, and discomfort index for every square kilometer in the city. Temperature estimates are updated every 5 minutes, providing data at a spatial and temporal resolution that is not available from any other service. EXTREMA connects vast networks of individuals over vast geographical areas (continental and later global scale) and facilitates fast flows of information. It also exploits the high penetration of smartphones and turns it into a digital infrastructure that can be used in Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR )to raise awareness, facilitate risk communication with the general public, and help build resilient communities.At city scale, the National Observatory of Athens (Public Research Centre) coordinates EXTREMA and collaborates with the City of Athens, the Medical School of the National Kapodistrian University of Athens and ARATOS-Systems. The Resilience and Sustainability Department (RSD) and DAEM SA- IT company of the city of Athens in collaboration with numerous municipal Agencies (Department of Childhood, Education and Lifelong Learning, Urban Nature, Social Solidarity and Health, Building Infrastructure) delivered and constantly updates the detailed map of Cooling centres of the municipal buildings that appear in the application. The Department of Social Solidarity and Health provided 9 of the 25 Municipal Elderly Centers and other air-conditioned places to be used during heatwave events for people in need in order to be protected from the extreme high-temperature weather events. Moreover, Near Field Communication (NFC) tags referring to “Cool Athens” campaign have been installed with the cooperation with the Athens Coordination Center for Migrant and Refugee issues (ACCMR) and international and local NGOS.EXTREMA project is funded by 75% by the Directorate‑General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid of the European Commission (EC). 25% is funded by own contribution of the partners. The project success stems from the establishment of strong links between different communities, e.g. policy-makers with scientists and stakeholders that result to better informed and more effective Disaster Risk Reduction actions and further cooperation on building community resilience. The financial support from the EC provided the necessary means to set up EXTREMA at European level. Starting from Athens, EXTREMA is being promoted as a success story via international city networks (C40, 100 Resilient Cities, and iCLEI).<b>What are the climate risk reduction goals/achievements?</b>EXTREMA goals are: 
EXTREMA also contributes towards understanding of climate change risk through the collection, analysis, management and dissemination of in-situ and space data relevant to extreme temperature. These can help develop more effective prevention policies and actions.EXTREMA has also improved city-to-city and cross border collaboration for climate change risk and in particular with regards to heat waves. Six constituencies – Athens, Paris, Rotterdam, Milan, Lisbon and the Island of Mallorca – have endorsed EXTREMA services, have learnt from each other and have worked to mitigate the heatwave impacts by enhancing the capacities of the people to anticipate heat, respond appropriately, and provide them with a network of cooling centres (outdoor and indoors, parks, municipal air conditioned buildings, free drinking water spots, fountains, water games and much more).<b>Next Steps</b>New mobile application version has been updated with all cities now sharing the same application platform.

Both depots host multiple services, which include washing bays, fueling stations, maintenance services and parking (both underground and ground level). The depots are climate-smart, as waste and wastewater treatment systems, green roofing, charging points for electric buses and solar panels are incorporated into the depots’ design. For instance, the depots have wastewater recycling capabilities and the washing bays use their own underground water. Moreover, these new depots will reduce the distance travelled by empty buses returning to their bases at the end of their shifts.<b>What is the innovation/policy/project/technology? How does it work</b>The city currently does not have a modern bus depot which provides all the above services in one stop. Furthermore, compared to the older bus terminus stops, these new depots will serve both public and privately owned buses. These make the depots unique at the city level as well as at the national level.The project is funded by the Addis Ababa City Administration. Within the city administration, there are a number of institutions working on the issue of transport, including the Addis Ababa Transport Program Mangement office. The Office is responsible for undertaking the construction of these depots. The city’s clear Transport Policy with a set vision to increase the mobility of passengers and efficiently deliver goods and services served as the basis for actors in the transportation sector to design such a large project with the city fund. After their completion, the depots will be handed over for management to the Anbessa city bus service enterprise which is a city-owned public transport company. The city budget capacity, ambitious city legislation, and financing mechanism all contributed to increasing the success potential of the project. <b>What are the climate goals/achievements?</b><b>CO2 emission reduction</b><b>Resilience: </b><b>Air Quality and Waste Management:</b><b>Next Steps</b>The city has a plan to scale-up the construction of depots in the coming years.

In spite of the 68% reduction of the fleet during the operation, the reduction in trips was of 39%, meaning that the average number of uses per bike almost doubled in the period, going from 6 to 11.1 daily uses, representing a significant gain in efficiency. The decrease in the number of units in turn led to a decrease in formal complaints, reaching one-fifth of the total documented before the pilot operation in a specific area. According to origin and destination data, it was also possible to determine areas that have a higher concentration of trips, which have some variation between bikes and scooters, but both converge in the spatial density of trips in the neighborhoods of Polanco, Reforma, Roma and Juárez. <img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA0NTQgMjA2IiB3aWR0aD0iNDU0IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjIwNiIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyNTEzX1NpcmlzX05IMS5vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmclM0YxNTc4NTA0MjQzIiBkYXRhLXc9IjQ1NCIgZGF0YS1oPSIyMDYiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/>Figure 5: Neighborhoods with most originating trips (left) and most destinations (right)<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA0NDcgMjAwIiB3aWR0aD0iNDQ3IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjIwMCIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyNTE3X3NpdGlzX05IXzMub3JpZ2luYWwucG5nJTNGMTU3ODUwNDMyNSIgZGF0YS13PSI0NDciIGRhdGEtaD0iMjAwIiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4="/>Figure 6: Neighborhoods with most originating trips (left) and most destinations (right)The joint effort with the companies was fundamental to satisfactorily attend to complaint reports about illegal use of sidewalks, access to buildings and inadequate parking, which negatively affected accessibility, mobility and safety, especially of children and people with disabilities. After reviewing the operation, it was found that dockless bikes use is predominantly related to school and work activities whereas scooters are associated with other types of trips, in different times of the day, possibly for leisure of intermediary work trips. Finally, the analysis was also able to identify specific areas that required further interventions in the public space, especially in the integration of clear parking spaces to the respective systems in order to ensure the safety of pedestrians using sidewalks and crosswalks. Based on this analysis, the city launched the first stage of the new one-year concession on April 16The second stage then started on May 29Since not all companies that participated in the tender were able to meet the legal and financial requirements, the city conducted another bidding for the remaining dockless bikes and scooters. The second round succeeded in providing 1,750 scooters adding up to the initially planned 3,500 units and 400 bikes, adding up to 2,800 bikes. This process is currently being analyzed by SEMOVI every three months through operational data analysis to evaluate whether the number of scooters and bikes is sufficient or if the numbers should be updated. <b>Next Steps</b>This process is currently ongoing, while SEMOVI is simultaneously analyzing the information gathered from previous rounds to implement parking points based on demand, modality and operation. 75 parking points have been defined and the Secretariat of Works is now building the parking areas across different areas of the city. The implementation of these points aims to organize SiTIS, replacing car parking lots and liberating space for pedestrians. Simultaneously, the parking zones allow cyclists to park their bikes in this new equipment. These points were a solution found in consultation with companies and local communities to incentivize the use of sustainable transport for short trips by assuring users of urban equipment available to start and end bike and scooter trips. Finally, these points are also integrated in the Integrated Mobility Network of CDMX, fostering intermodality. <b>Links to Further Information</b><a href="https://semovi.cdmx.gob.mx/storage/app/media/Reporte%20SITIS%202019.pdf">Análisis sobre la operación piloto de bicicletas sin anclaje y monopatines eléctricos</a><a href="https://data.consejeria.cdmx.gob.mx/portal_old/uploads/gacetas/cb5bd8fb286f1cab199c05fef8bb5e1d.pdf">Lineamientos para la Operación de los Sistemas de Transporte Individual Sustentable de la Ciudad de México, por personas morales</a><a href="https://data.consejeria.cdmx.gob.mx/portal_old/uploads/gacetas/8c8a38fc7cbd244378fd81d117fd1f03.pdf">Lineamientos técnicos para unidades que prestan servicio en los Sistemas de Transporte Individual Sustentable de la Ciudad de México</a><a href="https://semovi.cdmx.gob.mx/storage/app/uploads/public/5cf/5d5/736/5cf5d57363a30867997403.pdf">Presentación del proceso del permiso anual para operar en la Ciudad de México:</a>

Dependence on external sources of supply, increased demand due to urban expansion, overexploitation of the aquifer and inefficiencies in the water management system, generate a situation of vulnerability exacerbated by the adverse effects of climate change, such as increase in water demand, degradation of catchment areas and reduction in quality and recharge (Mexico City Resilience Office, 2016; SEDEMA, 2014).By 2050, a reduction of between 13% and 17% in the natural availability of water for Mexico City is estimated. Likewise, climate change can increase problems currently faced by water infrastructure, for example, through lower rainfall, which is linked to supply cuts to ration consumption and ensure resource supply; or more intense periods of rain, which exceeds the discharge capacity of the drainage causing flooding and affecting mobility and public health (SEDEMA, 2014).In this regard, Mexico City is in the process of designing its Local Climate Action Strategy (ELAC) 2020-2040 and the Climate Action Programme of Mexico City (PACCM) 2020-2026, which integrate climate policy cross-cutting and coordinated in the long, medium and short term, contributing to achieving the 2030 Agenda Objectives on Sustainable Development and meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement.Specifically, the adaptation policy of Mexico City will be aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement on adaptation and with the goals set in the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of Mexico. Thus, the ELAC and the PACCM will aim to reduce vulnerability and increase the adaptive capacity of communities in the face of the effects of climate change (community-based adaptation – AbC); reduce risks and increase the resilience of strategic infrastructure and productive systems (adaptation based on disaster risk reduction – DRR), and conserve and sustainably use the ecosystems and ecosystem services they provide (ecosystem-based adaptation – AbE).The climate change adaptation policy will be developed and implemented through participatory and inclusive projects, with a human rights and gender equity perspective, seeking to reduce the risks of the most vulnerable populations and ecosystems, and promoting capacity building and mainstreaming and integrality of environmental and development policies.<strong>What is the Policy? </strong>Specifically, the implementation of rainwater harvesting systems (“sistemas de captación de agua de lluvia” (SCALL)) promotes the development and use of green technologies, promotes education and awareness of the use and care of water and guarantees the inclusion of the most vulnerable groups. It also reduces the negative impacts of floods, guarantees the human right to water and health and favors the water security of Mexico City.Therefore, the SCALL are positioned as one of the strategic lines of action in the design of the ELAC and the PACCM, in order to reduce the water vulnerability of Mexico City and strengthen the participatory and inclusive construction of resilience.<strong>Links to further information</strong><a href="https://mce2.org/wmogurme/images/reports/CDMX_Resilience_Strategy.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mexico City Resilience Office (2016), Mexico City Resilience Strategy</a><a href="http://data.sedema.cdmx.gob.mx/sedema/images/archivos/temas-ambientales/cambio-climatico/PACCM-2014-2020completo.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Secretariat of the Environment (2014), Climate Action Program of Mexico City 2014-2020</a>

Relying on the “My Nanjing” APP, Nanjing launched a public service platform for low carbon travel for all citizens in Nanjing. The city also organized events themed on low carbon travel as well as developed green payment methods and carry out carbon credit rewards through integrating citizen's green travel data covering walking, bicycling, metro, and bus. At present, the low-carbon travel public service platform receives about 2 million clicks per day from a total number of 800,000 individual users.<b>What is the innovation/policy/project/technology? How does it work?</b>Accelerate the deployment of public bicycle service stations. There currently a total of 2,676 stations, an average daily usage of more than 220,000 people, 12 million registered users of shared bicycles, and 850,000 daily uses on average, bringing convenience to citizens for their “first and last mile” travel.<b>What are the CO2 reduction goals/achievements?</b>The “My Nanjing” app has a number of benefits to the public, such as bike sharing, green travel, and charging rental for new energy vehicles. By providing instant bike sharing and bus positioning, the public is encouraged to use public transportation. Prior to the introduction of this APP, priority was given to taxi or private car in traveling. After the app was launched, the instant and efficient public transportation network information promoted the use of public transportation, thereby achieving indirect emission reductions.

As a water-centric City, its residents face increasing risks of flooding. The combination of poor stormwater drainage across the City, due to recent and rapid urbanization, and increasing rates and intensity of floods has put the low-income and more vulnerable populations at serious risk. Nearly 700,000 people live in the City’s targeted watersheds and approximately 46,000 mostly low-income residents live in close proximity to the flood-prone Lake Soldati.In recent years, Buenos Aires has focused on flood protection in the City. In 2005, through the Ministry of Urban Development and Transportation (MDUyT), the City released a Hydraulic Master Plan to set in motion a path to protect its residents from the risk of eight floodable river watersheds in Buenos Aires. In particular, the City is focusing large capital investments in the Lake Soldati area, in the Cildáñez river basin, where a significant portion of low-income residents live. Throughout the course of the project, the Ministry of Environment and Public Spaces’ Urban Drainage Unit work to develop flood retention areas. The Urban Drainage Unit will also construct infrastructure networks to improve water distribution and wastewater collection, construct drainage channels to strengthen existing infrastructure, and enhance the urban public space. <b>What is the innovation? </b>The City of Buenos Aires is aware of the dangers of climate change and has taken several necessary steps to adapt its natural lands to better handle future climate events. From March 2001 to January 2006, the City developed the City’s Hydraulic Master Plan. This was the first planning document related to hydraulics, or the movement of water, in the City.After the Hydraulic Master Plan was published, the City of Buenos Aires created the group known as the Special Projects Unit of the Hydraulic Plan. The group was created to manage and implement the projects laid out in the Hydraulic Master Plan and the Water Risk Management Program (a program to implement adaptation work on the Arroyo Maldanado basin, improve green space, tree plantings, and more[2]). <b>Procure funding that influences and supports project development and community engagement </b>Most of the funding for the river basin adaptation projects is coming from the World Bank. The total project cost for the three basins Cildáñez, Maldonado, and Vega is US$326M. The World Bank is providing US$200M and the City of Buenos Aires is covering the remainder. The MDUyT’s Special Projects Unit of the Hydraulic Plan (UPEPH) is in charge of managing the fund and the project’s implementation. World Bank funded projects often come with support from the agency and a set of requirements, especially around reporting and community engagement. <b>Implement projects that address multiple needs and provide countless benefits</b>The adaptation of Lake Soldati and the resulting reduction in flood risk for the area will have significant benefits for the communities including environmental, social, economic, and health-related improvements. Firstly, the rehabilitation of the Lake involves an extensive clean-up and outreach campaign which improves the conditions for communities, attracts flora and fauna to the area, and ensures that residents have the practical knowledge and resources needed to keep Lake Soldati clean.Socially, this project significantly lowers the flood risk for low-income communities and contributes to the development of these communities by ensuring reliable access to essential services such as drinking water [8]. <b>Make engagement, communication and community growth part of the project</b>As part of the flood protection work across the City, there are several community engagement efforts that have been undertaken. In 2011, the Secretariat of Habitat and Inclusion (SECHI) was formed to coordinate engagement and foster relationships with targeted communities throughout Buenos Aires. As part of their mission, SECHI has an office located within the communities near Lake Soldati to build relationships with these particular communities. SECHI, with support from NGOs in the area, conducted many forms of engagement to get the community involved including door-to-door outreach, workshops with children, and focus group meetings [9].Through the World Bank funding, there are ongoing engagement efforts such as generating shareable communication for city dwellers and education programs. This has led to the Buenos Aires Office of Communication to work on community documents and resources and host informal seminars that educate and raise awareness of hazards and preventative actions to be taken during a flood event. For education, there are two programs planned. One aimed at the construction sector and education professionals to cover general knowledge about flood hazards, risks, vulnerability, and prevention, the other  supporting the ongoing emergency first respondents program targeting the populations living in slums and poor neighborhoods of Buenos Aires [10]. <b>Next Steps</b>Recognizing that flood events are the city’s greatest risk, Buenos Aires has prioritized climate adaptation projects. These projects positively impact a significant portion of the City’s population, including a large number of low-income residents. The watershed adaptation projects make a stronger Buenos Aires that is resilient and prepared for the future of climate change – including the low-income and marginalized communities.<b>Links to further Information </b><i>1. </i>2. <i>3. <a href="https://www.buenosaires.gob.ar/desarrollourbano/desarrollo/planes/">https://www.buenosaires.gob.ar/desarrollourbano/desarrollo/planes/</a> “plan-hidraulico”</i><i> 4. <a href="http://documents.banquemondiale.org/curated/ fr/142861468008743600/pdf/ISDS-Print-P145686-01-28-2014-1390968222209.pdf">http://documents.banquemondiale.org/curated/ fr/142861468008743600/pdf/ISDS-Print-P145686-01-28-2014-1390968222209.pdf</a></i><i>5. <a href="https://www.buenosaires.gob.ar/noticias/el-lago-soldati-recupera-su- ecosistema-original">https://www.buenosaires.gob.ar/noticias/el-lago-soldati-recupera-su- ecosistema-original</a></i><i>6. <a href="https://issuu.com/sechabitat/docs/caso-soldati-baja">https://issuu.com/sechabitat/docs/caso-soldati-baja</a></i><i>7 .<a href="https://issuu.com/sechabitat/docs/caso-soldati-baja">https://issuu.com/sechabitat/docs/caso-soldati-baja</a></i><i>8. <a href="https://issuu.com/sustainia/docs/cities100">https://issuu.com/sustainia/docs/cities100</a></i><i>9. <a href="https://stud.epsilon.slu.se/9716/1/bergman_l_161101.pdf">https://stud.epsilon.slu.se/9716/1/bergman_l_161101.pdf</a></i><i>10. <a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/287961468328119648/pdf/ PAD830-REVISED-OUO-9-R2016-0110-2.pdf">http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/287961468328119648/pdf/ PAD830-REVISED-OUO-9-R2016-0110-2.pdf</a></i><i>Image taken from </i>

It has a high utilization rate and the largest amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the country. It is a city that is very much aware of the challenges of climate change, particularly its role in increasing the risk of natural disasters, as indicated by the flood crisis of 2011. Bangkok wishes to make a contribution to the international community’s efforts to reduce carbon emission and conserve our planet, as well as increasing its own resilience.<b>What it is and its achievements</b>The origin of the Master Plan was the The Action Plan was successful in initializing projects aimed at addressing climate change at a local level. It nonetheless still faced some issues in its implementation. As a result, the BMA decided to design the<b>How it works</b><b>– JICA support for the implementation of the Master Plan –</b><i>Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA</i>The items listed below are the expected outputs for achievements within its 5 years of implementation: Activities under the Technical Cooperation Project include:The BMA established the Steering Committee, as the overseeing supervisory body of the Master Plan, which is jointly organized with the Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) of the Technical Cooperation Project. The Steering Committee’s function is to plan, supervise, advise and monitor the progress of the implementation of the Master Plan. To enhance the capacity building activities, the Steering Committee established a Working Group to set up the project's work plan and appoint five specific technical bodies (Task Forces) to drive technical activities in each area. JICA has sent 2 Long Term Experts who are stationed at the Department of Environment, Bangkok City Hall 2, as well as 8 Short Term experts, who support BMA in overall policies and sectoral activities, in cooperation with national specialists and staffs locally mobilized under the Technical Cooperation Project.The 1Following the above, the 2Also, to ensure the fruition and implementation of such mitigation and adaptation projects, a training in Japan was organized in May 2018, in close cooperation with the City of Yokohama. BMA officials learned how to maximize impacts and effectiveness of such projects, in terms of GHG emission reduction amount and strength of resilience, as well how to mobilize resources and stakeholders for scaling up action<b>– The mid-term review of the Master Plan –</b>The mid-term review called the Comprehensive Review of the progress of implementation of the Bangkok Master Plan on Climate Change 2013-2023, for the period of 2013-2017 was conducted in 2018 with the support of JICA Technical Cooperation Project. The purposes of the Review were to track the progress of implementation of the Master Plan by quantitative and qualitative assessment of actions listed, to identify challenges and needs and synthesize lessons learned, and to guide the way forward for further actions needed for strengthening climate actions. According to the review, increasing resources and capacity of the newly established Climate Change Strategy sub-division, strengthening the institutional framework, and mainstreaming climate change mitigation and adaptation by incorporating it into the BMA’s long-term development plans remains challenges for the BMA.<b>Next Steps</b>The BMA will set a new mitigation target for 2030 for its climate change actions in order to fill the gap between the current target under the Master Plan 2020, and consistent with the implementation under the Paris Agreement as well as Thailand’s NDC. In addition, the BMA will report the relevant situation of activities which were mentioned in the NDC Action Plan and NAP by specifying the roles and responsibilities of the BMA to the important missions in order to proceed in 2019-2020. Additionally, strengthening collaboration with governmental agencies was regarded as a key to expedite climate changes actions.

Due to having been in use for more than 30 years, their electrical and air conditioning systems have become less energy efficient and now cause high monthly electricity charges as well as incomplete usability. Consequently, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) has allocated the budget of the 2017 fiscal year to the amount of 580,000,000 Baht (THB) or 18,051,103 US Dollar1 (USD) in order to renovate the DPW and DDS buildings. The scope of renovation includes improving the capacity of the sanitary system, the electrical system and the air conditioning system. The duration of this project took place between 2017 and 2018. Ultimately, the objective was to reduce the cost of monthly electricity charges.For the improvement of the electrical system, the 36 Watt (W) fluorescents were replaced by 18-W LEDs. In order to improve the air conditioning system, the current 305-ton of refrigeration (TR) chiller and two of 335-TR chillers installed in each building, both with an efficiency of 0.85 kW/TR, will be changed to three 370-TR chillers installed in each building with an efficiency of 0.62 kW/TR. Replacing fluorescent bulbs to LEDs and using air conditioners with higher efficiency are both measures of energy efficiency and alternative energy defined in the Bangkok Master Plan on Climate Change 2013-2023. According to the energy data collected in 2012 (before the renovation project began), the total energy consumption of DPW and DDS buildings were at 7,111,000 kwh/year. However, after the completion of the project, the total energy consumption of both buildings dropped to approximately 3,086,153 kwh/year. It shows that the amount of energy consumption decreased by 4,024,847 kwh/year which is estimated to have saved 16,099,387 THB or 501,055 USD in electrical costs. When calculated by the formula provided by the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, it is shown that the emission rate of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) from electricity utilization is 0.59 tCO2-eq/MWh. So, after the renovation project, the GHG emission from both renovated buildings have decreased by around 2,374.66 tCO2-eq. The target of GHG emission mitigation under the Bangkok Master Plan on Climate Change 2013-2023 is set that, by the year 2023, all of the BMA buildings shall reduce the amount of total GHG emissions by 26,570 tCO2-eq compared to business as usual (BAU) (based on the year 2010). Therefore, the renovation project of the DPW and DDS buildings can reduce GHG emissions by up to 8.94 percent of the overall target in 2023.<strong>Next Steps</strong>After the completion of the renovation project, the concept of using LEDs and high efficiency chillers will be adopted as a measure applied for construction design of the new BMA buildings. This implementation will support the BMA in achieving its target of GHG emission mitigation under the Bangkok Master Plan on Climate Change 2013-2023 successfully.Image taken from https://fastly.4sqi.net/img/general/600×600/5315868_Zl-G_UmYQB_DUZc7vWkdlQ2z9saEobOuZsExYmfjin8.jpg

Dar es Salaam residents who use the Taraza intersection are now spending their time more productively instead of waiting in traffic jams. The transit time of public buses connecting peripheral areas to the city centre has also been significantly reduced. There are also social benefits to this project, as family members who commute to-and-from work by passing through the intersection can now spend less free time in transit and more time together.<strong>What are the CO2 reduction goals/achievements?</strong>The project successfully reduced the level of congestion and shortened transit journeys through the intersection. Other key achievements include:A special study would be needed in order to estimate the amount of GHG emissions reduced and quantify other co-benefits. <strong>Next Steps</strong>The Dar es Salaam Urban Transport Master Plan 2018 has initiated other similar projects. These include the improvements on the Ubungo interchange, the Chang’ombe flyover and the Aghakan – Osterbay bridge which are currently ongoing projects.<strong>Links to further Information</strong><a href="http://open_jicareport.jica.go.jp/pdf/11897527.pdf">Dar es Salaam Transport Policy and System Development Master Plan </a><a href="http://open_jicareport.jica.go.jp/pdf/12057915_01.pdf">Prepatory Survey on the Project For Improvement of Tazara Intersection in The United Republic of Tanzania Final Report </a><strong>Contact Details</strong>Shedrack Maximillan

This project fits within the scope of the National Climate Change Strategy of 2012.A total of 1180 meters of sea wall were constructed in the city’s effort to adapt to climate change, and it has enabled the beach to recover within its erected area. As a result, no more coastal erosion is happening. Dar es Salaam residents now use the area for recreation, and small businesses in the area are now in-place, providing new sources of income for youth and women. The wall has added to the beautification of the area, and new trees will add to the green environment of the city. From the mitigation side, the presence of a beautiful beach that is easily accessible from the city centre now allows city residents to spend their time in a naturally breezy area, thus reducing their use of air conditioning at home.The project will help reduce coastal erosion and make the beach area along Barack Obama Drive sustainable thanks to the added benefits of recreation and income generation. Other erosion-prone beach areas along Dar es Salaam’s waterfront could also benefit by the development of additional sea-retaining walls.<a href="https://www.oceandocs.org/bitstream/handle/1834/821/nyandwi_p121_130.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y"><i>Survey of the extent of human-induced beach erosion problems in Tanzania </i></a>Shedrack MaximilianHead of Waste Management UnitDar es Salaam City Council<a href="mailto:Shedrack_Maximilian@yahoo.co.uk"><i>Shedrack_Maximilian@yahoo.co.uk</i></a><i>Tel: +255754944504</i>

The programme included Within the heart of the historical Kuala Lumpur area, the city council has focused on transforming the district surrounding the confluence of the Klang and Gombak Rivers into a vibrant and liveable waterfront with high economic value. The riverfront was envisioned to be a place where people gather, communities thrive, and native flora and fauna flourish. The three key programme catalysts identified by the council as part of the project were:Various urban regeneration and pedestrianisation initiatives were undertaken as part of the project. These include:Through a mixed series of tested and experimental urban regeneration projects, the council has successfully created engaging and efficient spaces for residents and visitors while improving the aesthetics of the city.

This was through a joint partnership between the Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) and the local community at Raya Permai Flats, where a 2.4-acre park was established along with a maintenance system and programmes managed by the residents.From 2015 onwards, the programme shifted its focus to urban gardens, situated in smaller pocket spaces identified by local residents. With the success of a few initial urban gardens and farms, the city set a growth rate target of three farms a year. This target has been surpassed, with 10 applications having been approved this year alone.At the moment, there are 21 urban farms in the municipality, which range from 270 m2 to 9,700 m2 in size. Additional 10 gardens are to be established by the end of the year. To date, there are almost 59,000 m2 of community gardens within Kuala Lumpur, representing land that is being set aside for residents to cultivate both plants and a sense of community.Kuala Lumpur is in the process of formalising long-term goals in relation to community gardens. Furthermore, establishing these community gardens will be supporting the overall long-term ‘Low Carbon Society’ sustainability and climate action targets (achieving 30% green cover across the city and increasing the amount of open space per person to 2.0 ha per 1,000 population).With a strong focus on fostering community interaction and encouraging food resilience, the Urban Farm programme was initiated in 2015 and will contribute to climate action through a few key areas:At the moment, the CO2 reduction achievements are very minimal; but the city is establishing their long-term reductions goals as part of its Climate Action Plan (CAP) programme.<em>*The current estimated contribution of total greenery (and water body) in creating projects are estimated to account for 1% of total carbon emissions intensity reduction targets through the Low Carbon Society by 2030.</em>The City Hall of Kuala Lumpur continue facilitate community garden programmes, while undertaking measurement and target-setting exercises through the C40 Climate Action Planning Programme.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/localagenda21kl/">https://www.facebook.com/localagenda21kl/ </a>Pn.

The stationary energy footprint represented about 61%.The Greater Chennai Corporation has over the years worked to reduce the emissions footprint of the city by implementing various projects across domains.To reduce its stationary energy footprint, one of the major initiatives taken by Greater Chennai Corporation under the national Smart City Project was to replace its stock of existing sodium vapour lamps with LED lights. Sodium vapor lamps have been used for urban lighting traditionally, but the GCC believes that adapting to new changes is part of the process of progressing towards a better city. LED based lighting systems have become popular in recent years, thanks to their low voltage and brighter lighting capabilities. It is an excellent substitute to incandescent and compact fluorescent bulbs, as LEDs convert far more of their energy into light and less is wasted as heat. Increased efficiency means less strain for the electricity grid; the new lights also last much longer than their incandescent and fluorescent counterparts. The expected lifetime of LEDs is over 50,000 running hours. Finally, the maintenance cost is negligible, as they operate at a very low voltage.In summary, the benefits of converting Sodium Vapor lamps into LED lights are:<strong>What is the project? How does it work?</strong><strong>Brighter Chennai. Safer Chennai. Better Chennai.</strong>Chennai is the pioneer city in India for converting sodium vapor lamps into LED lights and can serve as example for other cities. The GCC has a primary responsibility for illuminating Chennai during the night hours. It has been shown that anti-social activities are drastically reduced following improved lighting coverage and illumination also has a beautifying effect on the city. During the duration of this project, a total of 1,772 sodium vapor lamps have been replaced by LED lights in the ABD region of T. Nagar, a popular shopping district.<strong>What are the CO2 reduction goals/achievements?</strong>The highlights of this project are: <strong>Next Steps</strong>Greater Chennai Corporation has successfully delivered the project and the maintenance period is currently underway.<strong>Contact details:</strong>Administrative Contact:CommissionerGreater Chennai Corporation<a href="mailto:commissioner@chennaicorporation.gov.in">commissioner@chennaicorporation.gov.in</a>Technical Contact:Chief EngineerElectrical Department<a href="mailto:ceelectrical@chennaicoporation.gov.in">ceelectrical@chennaicoporation.gov.in</a>

“A Re Sebetseng” Civic Pride Campaign Engages Citizens in Sustainable Waste Management
#################################################################################

            July 2019        The conceptualisation of ‘A Re Sebetseng’ was based on a community participation programme implemented in Kigali, Rwanda, explored by a team of officials from the City of Johannesburg (from EISD, Pikitup, and Mayoral Committee) during a visit to learn more about the national clean-up campaign. The original Rwandan mandatory campaign requested the community to participate in keeping the country clean following the civil war. The City of Johannesburg got inspired by this approach but turned it into a voluntary community participation and civic pride initiative. The campaign is intended to encourage communities to take care of and clean the environment. The Mayor actively leads and participates in the voluntary campaign every third Saturday of the month. The ‘Group Citizen Relationship & Urban Management’ (CRUM) plays a key role in the identification of waste hotspots and the mobilisation of logistical requirements. It also coordinates the mobilisation of communities and participation of ward committee councilors.The campaign was initially limited to City Departments and Municipal Entities and included the following activities:The campaign happens at two levels, one led by the Mayor and the other as a staff participatory session. The Mayoral A re Sebetseng takes place every 3rd Saturday of each month, with staff sessions taking place the Friday just before.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA1MDQgNTA0IiB3aWR0aD0iNTA0IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjUwNCIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyMjY1X1BpY3R1cmUxLm9yaWdpbmFsLnBuZyUzRjE1NjE5OTgyMjIiIGRhdGEtdz0iNTA0IiBkYXRhLWg9IjUwNCIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+"/><strong>What is the innovation? How does it work</strong>The ward councilors deployed in all regions of the city (8 regions in total) are responsible for the identification and selection of dedicated sites for the monthly mayoral campaign. The Mayor actively participates in the litter pick up and community members also get an opportunity to bring to the attention of the Mayor other community concerns that they may have.The campaign aim is to promote civic pride and get communities to start caring more about their environment. Activities include waste removal and cleaning of spaces, with the city government also offering the below:It is noteworthy to emphasise the principles of this engaged and inclusive approach, where communities are encouraged to participate directly in the waste management process.C40 is a platform for Mayors where to share best practice examples of challenges cities face and to learn from other cities alike. The Mayor of Johannesburg therefore has an opportunity and interest in sharing the concept of the ‘A Re Sebetsen’ campaign with other global leaders within the C40 Waste Network. Community participation and engagement is key to A Re Sebetseng. A total of 19,735 community members across 554 sites have participated in the campaign since 2017.<strong>Next Steps</strong>The City was also able to attract and leverage other global collaboration opportunities such as the Global Citizen Campaign, which was instrumental in raising the numbers of participants. The Mayor is seeking other similar partnerships in order to investigate other opportunities to encourage participation, such as offering tickets e.g. for the Johannesburg Zoo, various nature reserves, the Joburg Theatre, and also free tickets the BRT system.<strong>Contact Details</strong>Lebo MolefeCity of JohannesburgTel: +27 080 9335Email:

The intervention was not limited to energy efficiency only but included water efficiency and waste management practices.The initiative is informed by two broad drivers: on one side the need to improve energy efficiency in response to the local, national and global shift towards a greener, less carbon-intensive economy; on the other side the increasing availability of new technologies that can successfully contribute to greater energy efficiency, especially in lighting and air conditioning.The latter is particularly important, as the global energy demand for air conditioning is growing rapidly and is increasingly contributing to the growing carbon emissions associated with the power generation sector. The carbon emission link is particularly strong in South Africa where around 90% of power generation is coal-based, and coal will continue to dominate for the foreseeable future given the country’s large coal reserves and the ongoing construction of large new coal-fired power stations such as Kusile. Buildings consume almost 60% of all this electricity (Rode, Burdett & Soares, 2011).In air-conditioned commercial buildings, the largest energy share goes to lighting and air conditioning. Altogether, heating and cooling typically account for almost half of the buildings’ operation costs. Air conditioning is proved to contribute to grid instability, with cycling compressor motors turning continuously on and off (US Department of Energy, 2012). That is why the City fo Johannesburg targeted these major consumers of energy when attempting to improve energy efficiency in public buildings to reduce power consumption and save money.This approach was tested in the CoJ civic centre’s main building, in Braamfontein, which comprises of three Blocks, A, B and C. It was built in 1973 and has an estimated floor area of about 51,000 m2. The building is owned by the city council and managed by the Johannesburg Property Company, a property management company of the council. Its occupancy rate is above 70% for most of the time. About 1,700 people work permanently at the civic centre and about 800 people visit the centre every day, Monday to Friday. Block A is the tallest building with 20 floors including the ground floor and three basement floors used for parking. Block B is the second tallest with eight floors including one basement floor and two ground floors (ground floor & street level). Block C (the Council Chamber Wing – CCW) has seven floors including one basement floor, a ground floor and a lower ground floor.An assessment of the main building was conducted in 2017. It was agreed that although the building has three separate blocks, according to the Resource Efficient and Cleaner Production (RECP) Assessment it should be considered as one entity since all systems are interconnected throughout. The main electricity loads in the building come from heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), lighting, water heating and elevators.The detailed RECP Assessment focused on:The assessment also noted that the building had a central HVAC system in Bock C, but due to age and poor maintenance the system was no longer capable of providing efficient air conditioning to the block, therefore it has been switched off. Now, there’s only a limited number of split air conditioners in some areas of the building, but the rest all relies on natural ventilation.In addition, during winter months, about a third of the offices still use oil heaters for heating. The RECP In-Plant Assessment (IPA) was conducted on 3-12 June 2015 and the energy consuming equipment was assessed to determine the potential for improvement. The RECP assessment identified low and high-cost measures which, if implemented, could result in less use of resources, reduced operational costs and less negative environmental impact. The total emissions reduction estimated for this building would be of 2,183 tCO2e per year.<strong>Contact Details</strong>Lebo MolefeDirector of Air Quality and Climate Change departmentCity of JohannesburgTel: +27 11 080 9334Email:

Although the Municipality strives to improve the quality and living conditions of its people, it is becoming increasingly challenging to grow healthy and high-quality crops where cultivated areas are becoming increasingly scarce. As this case study shows, micro-gardening has proved to be an alternative and sustainable food system for a population facing poverty and food insecurity.The project described here is the result of decentralized cooperation between the cities of Dakar and Milan, with FAO and the NGO ACRA as strategic partners.<strong>What is the innovation? How does it work?</strong>Micro gardens are small, simple, inexpensive production units suited to high-density urban neighborhoods. Given the lack of suitable production spaces in the urban area, micro gardening in Dakar consists of growing food literally on the market tables.Recovered materials are used for micro-gardening:The benefit is tangible because micro gardens are real green lungs for the capital of Senegal, whose landscape is dominated by concrete. With the Micro Gardening programme, the City of Dakar is also developing a concept of a green city that is able to successfully adapt to the consequences of climate change and the scarcity of agricultural land. The programme also aims to contribute to regreening the capital. In a city where vegetation is particularly absent, the social and health benefits of expanding micro gardening is extremely important.Below are some of the key features of the programme and the benefits of micro gardening in Dakar:<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA1MTQgNDUyIiB3aWR0aD0iNTE0IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjQ1MiIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyMjU1X1NjcmVlbnNob3RfMjAxOS0wNi0xN19hdF8xNC4yNi41NC5vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmclM0YxNTYwNzc4MDc4IiBkYXRhLXc9IjUxNCIgZGF0YS1oPSI0NTIiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/><strong>Next steps </strong>The Micro Gardening programme is integrated into the city's master plan. The city government aims to support the beneficiaries with the acquisition of agricultural equipment and the establishment of a purchase center for the project actors’ association, which needs additional funding to improve its productivity. A key concern is especially the availability of required agricultural equipment, which is momentarily not possible to find on the local market.<strong>Links to further information </strong><a href="http://www.fao.org/senegal/fr" rel="noopener" target="_blank">www.fao.org/senegal/fr</a><a href="http://www.fao.org/3/ca0493en/CA0493EN.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dakar: Creating micro-gardens using recycled materials</a><strong>Contact details</strong>Ms. Ndeye Ndack Pouye MbodjCoordinator of the Micro Gardening Project of the City of DakarTel: 00221 77 652 63 89Email:

The Revival of Karachi Circular Railway as Key Part of the ‘Karachi Transportation Improvement Plan 2030’
#################################################################################

            June 2019        Karachi is located in the Sindh Province of Pakistan and has a population of 16.05 million (2017) spread over an area of 1,200 sq.km. The public transportation situation in Karachi is such that the average number of people competing per one seat in a bus is 45 compared to 12 in Mumbai and 8 in Hong Kong.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA3OTUgNDc0IiB3aWR0aD0iNzk1IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjQ3NCIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyMjUzXzAub3JpZ2luYWwucG5nJTNGMTU2MDUyNjkxMiIgZGF0YS13PSI3OTUiIGRhdGEtaD0iNDc0IiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4="/>Following is the mode share comparison by vehicle type and occupancy between 2008 and 2018.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMDQwIDY2NSIgd2lkdGg9IjEwNDAiIGhlaWdodD0iNjY1IiBkYXRhLXU9Imh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGd3d3LmM0MC5vcmclMkZ3cC1jb250ZW50JTJGc3RhdGljJTJGb3RoZXJfdXBsb2FkcyUyRmltYWdlcyUyRjIyNDZfMS5vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmclM0YxNTYwNTIyNzUyIiBkYXRhLXc9IjEwNDAiIGRhdGEtaD0iNjY1IiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4="/>Fig.1. Mode share comparison by vehicle type and occupancy between 2008 and 2018.In the past decade, there has been a consistent modal shift away from public transport (see Fig.1 above). In 2018, public buses account for only 3% of the overall vehicles on Karachi’s arterial routes and they transport about 34% of the passengers, compared to respectively 6% and 53% in 2008. Taxis and auto-rickshaws (paratransit) represent 13% of the total volume of vehicles in 2018 and they transport 12% of the people, compared to 10% and 6% respectively in 2008.Also the mode share of private cars has slightly dropped, now representing 31% of the overall vehicles and transporting 21% of the people compared to 36% and 25% in 2008.In comparison, the mode share of motorcycles has increased notably, now transporting 33% of the overall users compared to 16% a decade before, accounting for 53% of all vehicles transiting on the roads of Karachi compared to 47% in 2008.Clearly, the above statistics makes for a compelling case for strengthening public transportation within the city. Accordingly, the Government of Pakistan, with the help of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), formulated the ‘Karachi Transportation Improvement Plan 2030’, which includes the following (refer to Fig.2 below):<strong>Long term strategy </strong><strong>Medium term strategy </strong><strong>Immediate action programme </strong>IntercityIntracity (Karachi)<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMTM5IDY0NSIgd2lkdGg9IjExMzkiIGhlaWdodD0iNjQ1IiBkYXRhLXU9Imh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGd3d3LmM0MC5vcmclMkZ3cC1jb250ZW50JTJGc3RhdGljJTJGb3RoZXJfdXBsb2FkcyUyRmltYWdlcyUyRjIyNDdfMi5vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmclM0YxNTYwNTIyNzcyIiBkYXRhLXc9IjExMzkiIGRhdGEtaD0iNjQ1IiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4="/>Fig.2. Karachi Mass Transit Plan.In this case study, we’ll focus specifically on one key element of the long term strategy, the revival of the Karachi Circular Railway.<strong>Revival of the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) </strong>The Karachi circular railway was first commissioned in 1964. It remained an effective mass transportation system until 1984 when the operational efficiency started deteriorating, resulting in a reduction of ridership and subsequent closure in December 1999.Considering the urgent intervention required to improve the status of public transportation in the city, the Government of Pakistan has taken up the revival of the KCR to de-congest the city core and enable efficient and convenient movement of people (Fig.3). The project is now also part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).As the former KCR was not in use since 1999, about 20% of the right-of-way (RoW) was encroached on by informal settlements. In order to revive the KCR, the government has decided to secure the land within RoW, but for this to happen without negatively impacting the communities in informal settlements, it introduced a rehabilitation and resettlement programme for the Project Affected Households (PAHs), which also applies to BRT corridors. The resettlement programme is a participatory programme, whereby PAHs are consulted and engaged in the planning and decision making related to the provision of support they are eligible for.A detailed Resettlement Action Plan study of these informal settlements has been prepared following a thorough interaction and consultation with the people who are to be relocated. Since the relocation of PAHs would have taken 4 to 5 years, resulting in a huge delay of the project, a Domestic Plan has been worked out to separate the resettlement component from the main KCR Project.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA4NjQgNTc3IiB3aWR0aD0iODY0IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjU3NyIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyMjQ4XzMub3JpZ2luYWwucG5nJTNGMTU2MDUyMjc4MiIgZGF0YS13PSI4NjQiIGRhdGEtaD0iNTc3IiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4="/>Fig.3. Route Alignment of the KCR.The KCR is a 43.13 km long railway network which is now planned to be developed as a mass rapid transit rail network. A 14.95 km segment of the KCR will be developed at the ground level while the remaining 28.18 km segment as an elevated corridor. The overall cost of the project is of USD 1,971 billion, but once complete and operational the KCR is expected to transport about 550,000 passengers per day.<strong>Implementation Status </strong>1. Resolution of issues between Government of Pakistan (GoP) & Government of Sindh (GoS):2. Removal of informal settlements – In pursuance of the directives of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the district administration and KMC & DS Railways have started ensuring RoW.3. Protection of RoW – GoS has already approved the Annual Development Plan Scheme to provide fences to protect the railways.<strong>Next Steps </strong>The transportation system has been planned for the entire city core. As and when possible the network will be further expanded.

Improving Living Conditions in Poverty-Stricken Areas in Amman by Implementing Green Infrastructure
#################################################################################

            June 2019        The partially unplanned infrastructure of East Amman’s neighbourhoods has created scarcity of open spaces, lack of greenery and inadequate connectivity of sidewalks, stair networks and streets. Access to public facilities and basic urban services (e.g. public transport, waste management, water and energy supply, health care, education and public security) are bound to long distances or sometimes completely cut off. Due to housing density, any construction, rehabilitation or maintenance of public open spaces (POS) is challenging. In some places, incomplete waste collection and inadequate urban infrastructure have led to deteriorated social interactions and environmental hazards such as flooding and soil pollution.At the same time, urban green spaces are known to mitigate heat and air pollution and contribute to urban wellbeing. Access to community gardens and recreational facilities is also strongly linked to reductions in crime and in particular to reduced juvenile delinquency. As the world’s cities densify, continuing to value green spaces in cities is vital, but also a challenge; particularly where there is pressure for space, resources and development. Despite these challenges, cities need to revive and invest in POS to enable environmental and social benefits and build attractive cities for all.The ‘Improving Living Conditions in poverty-stricken Areas’ project (ILCA) aims to create ownership and enhance the quality of life of Amman’s residents through community participatory involvement in the design, planning and management of the newly created or revived public open spaces.Improving the connection to public transport plays a prominent role, as well as increasing the accessibility of public spaces, with particular attention to women and girls’ specific needs. The project also intends to raise awareness on the potential of green infrastructure to mitigate/adapt to climate change and support Jordan in the achievement of their commitments at the global and national level, such as the SDGs and NDCs.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA2NDggMzY2IiB3aWR0aD0iNjQ4IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjM2NiIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyMjQyX1NjcmVlbnNob3RfMjAxOS0wNi0xM19hdF8xNy41MS40My5vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmclM0YxNTYwNDQ0NzI5IiBkYXRhLXc9IjY0OCIgZGF0YS1oPSIzNjYiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/><strong>What is the innovation? How does it work? </strong>Several pilot sites in East Amman have been selected to implement practical examples of green urban design and thereby illustrate different elements of green infrastructure. At the neighbourhood level, the aim is to counteract the degradation of urban spaces, improve social cohesion and foster interaction between different population groups. At a higher scale, the infrastructure networks will contribute to filtering air and water pollutants, preserving local biodiversity, decreasing the impact of urban heat waves and avoiding soil erosion.<strong>Links to further information </strong><a href="https://www.c40.org/wp-content/static/other_uploads/images/2243_Brochure_Green_Infrastructure.original.pdf?1560444744" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Brochure_Green Infrastructure</a><strong>Contact Details </strong>Greater Amman MunicipalitySajeda Alnsour / Project ManagerTel: 9626436111 Ext. 2546Mobile: +962777742971Email:  Sajida.Alnsoor@AmmanCity.gov.jo

The system will include the development and design of stops, stations, passenger information points, interchanges and terminals, with buses running on a frequency possibly as low as 3 minutes along Amman’s busiest corridors.The BRT corridors in Amman are not being designed in isolation. Rather, they are being incorporated into an integrated public transport network. For a user to get from their doorstep to their workplace, they may require more than just a BRT ride. This is why an extensive network of feeder services is being designed along with the BRT. Feeders will mostly be buses but may also include smaller vehicles. They are meant to carry users to the nearest BRT stop and will also provide a high-quality and frequent service that will minimize the time people have to sit and wait for the bus.The current project includes the construction, planning and equipping of 2 BRT dedicated corridors having a total length of 25km and a total cost of around 250 Million USD, of which two-thirds is financed by the ‘Agence française de développement’ (AFD). It is expected that 140 articulated buses will eventually carry more than 315,000 passengers per day. The 2 routes will serve major transit routes in the city (e.g. the University of Jordan, the Sport City and the Mahatta Terminal).The main objectives of Amman’s BRT urban network are the following:<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA1OTIgNjAyIiB3aWR0aD0iNTkyIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjYwMiIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyMjM5X1NjcmVlbnNob3RfMjAxOS0wNi0xM19hdF8xNi40Mi4yMS5vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmclM0YxNTYwNDQwNjE5IiBkYXRhLXc9IjU5MiIgZGF0YS1oPSI2MDIiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/><strong>What is the innovation? How does it work?</strong>The project aims to deliver premium quality, economically feasible, car-competitive mass transit system for all of Amman's citizens.The implementation of the BRT system consists of three major categories, including:Amman’s BRT is expected to be operational from 2021 and is planned to increase public transport mode share from 14% to 40% by 2025.<strong>Next Steps </strong>The BRT project started in 2010. It stopped in the summer of 2011 amid concerns over its feasibility and funding capacities, which saw the Cabinet suspend it and halt all related tenders. In 2015, the government decided to resume the project, as part of a plan to provide transport solutions and ease traffic congestion in Amman. Therefore, a concession contract will now be established with a private operator who will provide buses and manage the joint operation of both Amman and Amman-Zarqa BRTs (the latter being financed by the Jordanian Government).The system will be expanded over time to cover all of Amman's neighborhoods.<strong>Links to further Information</strong><a href="https://www.c40.org/wp-content/static/other_uploads/images/2241_GAM_BRT_brochure.original.pdf?1560440644" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BRT brochure</a><strong>Contact Details </strong>Greater Amman Municipality / Public Transport DirectorateRula Al-Khashman, BRT Project CoordinatorMobile: +9627990 54092Email:

After car owners register and add their vehicles to the platform, they can voluntarily apply for reducing driving through it. After they fulfill their commitments, confirmed by the smart traffic monitoring equipment, they get credits that can be redeemed for various rewards in the “Chengdu e-Travel” Welfare Mall.<strong>What is the innovation? How does it work? </strong>The Benefit-all Carbon-reduction initiative will give full play to the advantages of the “Chengdu e-Travel” platform. It calculates the “carbon assets” generated from car owners’ emission reductions, and uses the benefit-all mechanism and market mechanism to exchange credits for low-carbon products or even cash to motivate low-carbon behaviours. The benefit-all carbon-reduction mechanism mainly aims to incentivise energy-saving and carbon reduction behaviours.<strong>What are the CO2 reduction achievements? </strong>Since the launch of the platform on July 23, 2017, across six administrative divisions, i.e. Wuhou, Jinniu, Jinjiang, Qingyang, Chenghua and Gaoxin, a total of 14,700 private cars applied for reducing driving, resulting in a total of 169,700 days of reduced driving and leading to emissions reduction of nearly 2,000 tCO2e.<strong>Contact Details </strong>Chengdu Municipal Development and Reform CommissionNo.2 Jinyue Xi Road, Chengdu CityTEL: 028-61886168<a href="http://www.cddrc.gov.cn/reform/detail.action?id=853356" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://www.cddrc.gov.cn/reform/detail.action?id=853356</a>

It has not only greened the community, but also enabled the residents of the community to eat completely ecological vegetables. Amongst more than 50 households in the community, 23 households participated in planting vegetables. The vegetables harvested are then distributed across the 23 households.<strong>What is the innovation?

It helps understand the overall level and trend of urban vulnerabilities, identify major climate hazards and vulnerable regions and sectors, and it serves as a technical support for assessing climate change vulnerabilities in Chinese cities.<strong>Development of climate scenarios </strong>For the very first time, climate change scenarios have been developed for the city of Wuhan. The estimate of future climate change is mainly based on the atmospheric circulation model * RCPs were used in the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC in 2014 as a basis for the report’s findings. The four RCPs range from very high (RCP8.50) through to very low (RCP2.6) future concentrations. The numerical values of the RCPs refer to the concentrations in 2100.

The Municipality of Salvador, through its Secretariat for Sustainability, Innovation and Resilience (Secis), envisioned the Municipal Center COLABORE (inaugurated on May 10 2019) as the first public co-working space for micro-enterprises, individual micro-entrepreneurs (MEIs), startups or people, who aim to develop social impact solutions for the city and also contribute to achieving a better and more sustainable future for all its residents.In partnership with SEBRAE, the Brazilian agency to support the management of micro and small businesses, COLABORE was created amidst the trees of one of the most popular meeting places of the capital of Bahia: Parque da Cidade, a public city park counting an average of 100 thousand visitors per month.  The Municipality invested 1.2 million reais in the project. Sixteen old maritime containers have been reused and distributed over an area of 2,700 square meters.COLABORE forms part of the Resilience Strategy of Salvador and is another successful delivery of the Sustainable City axis – Salvador 360 – a program aiming to accelerate the social economic growth of the city.The proposal was to establish a shared work environment, favorable to the creation of, and interaction between the entrepreneurial community. Users of COLABORE will have access to shared offices, an auditorium, and several meeting rooms. In addition to the benefits offered by the infrastructure itself, the coworking spaces will allow the interaction between professionals from different areas, the expansion of business networking, while reducing or even eliminating costs of head offices.<strong>What is the innovation? How does it work?</strong>It is a sustainable infrastructure!In addition to the fact that the structure has been built from reused containers, COLABORE also counts on several sustainable technologies, such as vegetation cover, the use of cross ventilation, a capture rainwater system, photovoltaic solar panels, sewage treatment and reuse solutions, permeable flooring, an intelligent refrigeration management system, natural acoustic barriers, as well as bike racks to encourage active mobility.Eight modules make up the space, two of which are reserved for co-working, with 26 workstations that allow training courses, in areas like innovation and social entrepreneurship, to be carried out periodically, promoting the acceleration of Salvador's innovation ecosystem; and another 20 stations in two other modules host the social business incubator.COLABORE was designed to contribute towards the city’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and A public notice will be launched to select startups, microenterprises, individual micro-entrepreneurs (MEIs) and private individuals who have ideas for sustainable projects for the city and wish to work there. The selection will take into account the alignment of project proposals with the SDG.Sustainable elements present in the structure of Colabore are:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY292VhbCI0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMjc2IDcxNyIgd2lkdGg9IjEyNzYiIGhlaWdodD0iNzE3IiBkYXRhLXU9Imh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGd3d3LmM0MC5vcmclMkZ3cC1jb250ZW50JTJGc3RhdGljJTJGb3RoZXJfdXBsb2FkcyUyRmltYWdlcyUyRjIyMTZfU2NyZWVuc2hvdF8yMDE5LTA1LTMxX2F0XzE3LjA1LjE2Lm9yaWdpbmFsLnBuZyUzRjE1NTkzMTkzMDQiIGRhdGEtdz0iMTI3NiIgZGF0YS1oPSI3MTciIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/></a>

More than half of the city’s total population resides in informal settlements.There is a lack of organized solid waste management systems in the slums, partly due to poor accessibility, and lack of proper support infrastructure.There is, therefore, an urgent need to address the existing gaps in waste management in these areas. Perennial flooding has been attributed to blockages along sewer systems, and indiscriminate waste disposal led to waste in gullies, street medians, and water bodies. It is estimated that Nairobi generates 2,400 tons of waste daily. Out of this, more than 50% is organic.The current urbanization trend indicates that waste generation will continue to increase. The County Government established several partnerships with a number of institutions to set up facilities that can add value to the different waste streams, especially in areas with vulnerable individuals. Umoja estate was one such area.The project entails empowerment of local communities in the waste management chain. There is an ongoing development of a biogas power plant that is planned to benefit over 5,000 individuals in the surrounding area, and that will be built on a piece of land provided by the City County Government.<strong>How does it work? </strong>The biogas power plant will be fed with food waste from surrounding estates, and it will also use animal waste, such as cow dung.The plant will be able to capture, collect and process biogas for domestic use. The gas will be distributed among 5,000 local households and to nearby restaurants. This project is foreseen to positively impact the local residents’ economy and leave the surroundings cleaner.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA3NzUgNjMxIiB3aWR0aD0iNzc1IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjYzMSIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyMjAyX05haXJvYmlfYmlvZ2FzLm9yaWdpbmFsLnBuZyUzRjE1NTgxMDIxOTciIGRhdGEtdz0iNzc1IiBkYXRhLWg9IjYzMSIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+"/><strong>What are the CO2 reduction goals? </strong>The project will significantly reduce the city’s GHG emissions along with the number of illegal dumpsites within the Umoja estate, especially those with predominantly organic waste composition. This means that methane emissions from decomposing food will also diminish.Secondly, it will reduce the need to rely on wood-burning stoves, therefore significantly reducing CO2 emissions while at the same time bringing extra health benefits from switching to a cleaner cooking method.<strong>Next steps</strong>Nairobi City County is open to ideas that would go towards city’s emissions reduction. The success of the current plant will, in a large way, inform the next steps. It will be important to evaluate the appeal the project will have to other potential partners, such as the national government, the community, the private sector, as well as individuals.<strong>Contact details </strong>Mr. David MakoriCounty Chief Officer- Environment and Natural ResourcesNairobi City County GovernmentP.O Box 30075-00100Nairobi

The project looked at the ‘Meilong San Cun’ residential community and the community school as the base to explore sustainable development of an urban community in practice through recycling domestic waste, using green energy, building eco-diversified residential area, and other actions.The construction of low-carbon communities is not only about strengthening infrastructures, such as the establishment of rainwater collecting facilities and renewable energy power generation facilities, but also about changing lifestyles and habits, such as changing the way people dispose of their waste.<strong>What is the innovation? </strong>There are many exemplary measures in the community, such as the below 'waste to recycling credits’ system:Every Thursday afternoon, residents of Meilong San Cun can take their own used newspapers, plastic bottles, used household appliances and other wastes to a designated waste management room, and sort them out by categories for recycling. Residents can use their mobile phone number or WeChat to register. Then they take the sorted waste to a recycling station at a fixed time. The workers at the station weigh the garbage, convert it into recycling credits and put it on the person’s membership card. The credits can be redeemed at a nearby convenience store to buy daily groceries, such as a cup of yogurt, a box of peanuts, or even a bucket of oil.More broadly, the community presents the following innovations:Cultivate resident’s low-carbon behaviors: Low-carbon facilities: Water-saving resource utilization: <strong>Links to further information</strong>(Chinese) (Chinese)

Located in Seih Al Dahal, Dubai, the power plant will reduce over 6.5 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year starting from 2030.The solar park uses a range of photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP) technologies. Besides, it also includes an Innovation Centre and it is home to one of the largest Research & Development centres in the region, which includes PV solar and CSP testing facilities and a solar-powered water desalination plant.<u>The Power Plant</u>Operation of the park began in 2013, with the launch of the first phase of the project, having a capacity of 13MW. The second phase of the solar park was successfully inaugurated in April 2017, adding up the total capacity to 200 MW.With regards to future expansions, the third phase will be implemented in stages (200MW implemented in 2018, 300MW for the second stage, and further 300MW for the third stage). Finally, the fourth phase – 950MW – has received the lowest international Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) bid of USD 7.3 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) for the CSP plant, and added 250MW of PV solar panels with a cost of just 2.4 USD cents per kilowatt hour, the world's lowest. The CSP Plant will feature a 260 meter solar tower, the world’s tallest of its kind.Total investments amount to AED 16 billion (≈ USD 4.4 billion).<u>The Research &amp; Development Centre </u>The Research & Development Centre clearly demonstrates DEWA’s vision to promote sustainability in energy supply, diversify energy sources, and create a business environment that encourages innovation. It supports Dubai’s plan to build a knowledge-based economy by improving efficiency standards and supporting renewable energy initiatives. The Centre contributes to strengthening Dubai’s position as a global hub for Research and Development in renewable energy, clean technologies and sustainability related initiatives.<u>The outdoor Photovoltaic solar testing facility </u>The main purpose of the outdoor testing facility is to study and evaluate the performance and reliability of solar panels under desert climatic conditions. It monitors performance (energy production, yield, degradation rate, dust effect, etc.) for each solar panel over a long term period.<u>Photovoltaic Powered Reverse Osmosis Water Desalination Plant </u>For research and development purposes in the field of water desalination using solar energy, DEWA built a pilot solar-powered reverse osmosis water desalination plant. The production capacity is 50 m3 per day of drinking water (with bottled water quality), achieved by desalinating brackish water using solar energy with Energy Storage Batteries. The Innovation Centre DEWA is building also an Innovation Centre, equipped with the latest renewable and clean energy technologies, which will serve as an exhibition centre featuring the newest innovations in the field. Through this centre, DEWA aims to raise awareness on sustainability issues while enhancing national capabilities and increasing competitiveness.<strong>Links to further information </strong><a href="https://www.dewa.gov.ae/en/customer/innovation/renewable-energy/mohammed-bin-rashid-al-maktoum-solar-park" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park </a><a href="https://government.ae/en/about-the-uae/strategies-initiatives-and-awards/local-governments-strategies-and-plans/dubai-clean-energy-strategy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050</a>

Surrounded by mountains and facing the sea, it is a rare place for practicing good ‘feng shui’<sup>1 </sup><strong>What is </strong>The residential buildings in the Dayou Tianyuan community are all provided with solar water heaters, deemed to save 1.5 to 2 million kWh of electricity every year across the whole community, worth approximately  240,000 yuan (≈ USD 35,000).Smart heating systems are another example of the energy efficiency measures implemented. Dayou Company has built a hot water heating center with a capacity of 3.5 million square meters, equipped with a low-consuming boiler with a thermal efficiency of 83.72% (well above the government requirement of 68%). At the same time, high-quality thermal insulation material has been used to make the pipe networks and the heat exchange station more thermally efficient (92.6~99.8%), minimizing heat loss during the heat transfer.In addition, households have been provided with an effective home insulation system, installed on the external walls and stairwells. The outer walls are covered with a 5cm thick polystyrene board, while the ground and ceiling are made with low-temperature radiant heating technology. According to the inspection of the Quality Supervision Office of the Dalian Research Institute of Building Sciences, the actual energy consumption of Dayou Tianyuan is only 16.5 W/m2, which enabled to save up to 67% on coal consumption.There is also a wastewater treatment station and a ground reservoir located within the community. The latter is used to store recycled water treated by the wastewater treatment facility. The recycled water is then pumped into all the households for flushing purposes, or is used for gardening, fire fighting and car washing. The wastewater treatment station processes up to 1,000 tons of waste water per day, and is not only limited to the 1,480 households of the community, but is also treating domestic sewage coming from other 2,300 households.At the beginning of the construction of the Dayou Tianyuan community, water veins were identified and a large water collector well was built aligned with the wellsprings. Surface runoff, such as rainwater, seeps through the ground and road surface into the collector well, where it is successfully stored.An artificial recycling system for treated water, a semi-natural recycling system for surface water and a natural recycling system for groundwater are all components of this unique water recycling system. According to reports, only by recycling water alone, the community is able to save 30% of tap water and more than 100,000 yuan (≈ USD 14,600) every year.<strong>Contact Details </strong>Guan JunDalian Dayou Real Estate Development Co., Ltd.30-2-1-1 Jingtian Street, Ganjingzi District, Dalian City, Liaoning Province0411-84741855<a href="mailto:huangln@evangel.net">huangln@evangel.net</a><a href="http://13352227160@163.com">13352227160@163.com</a>

The platform unites car networking companies, insurance companies, banks and other partners to promote a new integrated model in which public and private join hands to encourage a low-carbon society. The participants are rewarded based on how much they cut off driving. They may be rewarded up to hundreds or thousands RMB.<strong>What is </strong>The platform uses smart devices to identify each user's emission reduction behavior, displaying reductions directly in everyone’s personal 'emissions reduction account'. Through a voluntary trading model, users’ emission reductions are then converted into cash.There are two ways of participating in the scheme:1) Participation with deposit. The vehicle owner must pay 499 RMB as a deposit for the onboard smart equipment. After the equipment is installed, the driver can get a reward of 0.5 RMB per day.2) Participation without deposit. The vehicle owner buys the car insurance and uses the onboard smart device for free. After the car insurance takes effect, the car insurance platform rewards with 0.5 RMB per day, and the extra reward given by the car networking company can be obtained by cutting off driving.Based on recent data, the annual reward can vary from hundreds to thousands of RMB. The more you avoid driving, the bigger is the reward.<strong>Links to further information</strong><a href="http://www.cbex.com.cn/article/xxpd/bjsdt/201801/20180100061304.shtml" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://www.cbex.com.cn/article/xxpd/bjsdt/201801/20180100061304.shtml</a><a href="http://www.huaxia.com/jtsd/bjyw/2018/01/5627986.html">http://www.huaxia.com/jtsd/bjyw/2018/01/5627986.html </a><strong>Contact Details </strong>Beijing Environment ExchangeTel: (010) 66295566

In the capital city of Hanoi alone, 10,000 tons of solid waste are generated everyday. Without a sustainable recovery process, waste resources are not being optimised.Such resources could be for example utilised to generate electricity. Effective waste treatment for energy generation will help ensure energy security, reduce environmental pollution, and contribute to effective land use and green sustainable economic development.Currently, waste-to-energy technologies are becoming a popular solution around the world to reduce emissions from waste while contributing to divert power generation towards alternative energy sources. In Vietnam, the government has also established a range of mechanisms aiming to encourage electricity generation from waste, with all energy-from-waste production being purchased by the national utility company.The utilization of landfill gas in power generation is a highly regarded project for its double benefit of reusing waste to produce electricity. It is being piloted in Hanoi, to lead the way in transforming other waste facilities across Vietnam.<strong>What is the project? How does it work?</strong>The Hanoi Urban Environment Company (URENCO) and its partners (T&T Group and 3 leading Korean companies) agreed in September 2017 to jointly design, build, finance and operate a facility that will gather, process, and treat methane gas emitted from decomposing garbage to produce electricity, aiming to reduce methane emissions, environmental pollution and dependence on fossil fuels.The landfill gas utilization plant will be developed at the Nam Son landfill in the Soc Son District, just outside Hanoi. The waste treatment complex at Nam Son landfill is the largest of its kind in Hanoi, treating around 4,000 metric tons of garbage per day and stretching across 83.5 hectares.Following the completion of a feasibility study, the facility is expected to have a total capacity of 5MW.The equipment that will be installed includes a gas collection network, an extraction and flaring station including high temperature enclosed flares, and monitoring and control systems.<strong>What are the CO2 reduction goals?</strong>It is estimated that the project will achieve emissions reductions of about 128,304 tCO2e/year.<strong>Next Steps</strong>Construction is expected to start in 2019 and take 15 months at a cost of US$13.14 million. The plant will be operating for 15 years. At present, the feasibility study for the project is being finalised and submitted to Hanoi People’s Committee for approval.<strong>Links to further information</strong><a href="https://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/DB/RINA1274714283.4/view" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UNFCC: Project 3733</a><strong>Contact Details</strong>Ms. Vu Thi ThuyInternational Cooperation DepartmentHanoi Urban Environment Company Limited (URENCO) No. 282 Kim Ma, Ba Dinh, Hanoi, VietnamTel: (024)38454807 – Fax: (024)38236384

Over 5 million motorcycles and 585,000 private cars are occupying 85.8% of the city’s road networks. Congestion was already becoming a critical problem in the city. Traffic was in general unorderly and sometimes chaotic at intersections, posing safety concerns and exacerbating air pollution especially for vulnerable groups such as women, children, elderly, and long-distance motorists.City’s efforts to curb motorization aimed to restrict motor vehicle access to the inner city by the year 2030 and to increasingly promote public transport. With these motivations, the City of Hanoi, backed by the World Bank, approved the construction of a critical road infrastructure (a Bus Rapid Transit system) to improve access to city’s less developed areas and to facilitate an environmentally sustainable urbanization of Hanoi.This BRT project has been designed as a Specific Investment Loan, with the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) co-financing a set of initiatives that either would reduce barriers to project implementation or maximize its global environmental benefits. The project is consistent with the GEF Operational Program 11th objective of ‘Promoting Environmentally Sustainable Transport’ and the GEF climate change strategic priority related to sustainable transport. The Hanoi Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system proposed in this project has also been the first such system financed by the World Bank in Asia, with the potential to be a high-profile demonstration for bus-based mass rapid transit in the region.<strong>What is the project? How does it work?</strong>The Hanoi project is the first BRT line in Vietnam. It consists so far of one route, a 14.7 km long busway (one bus lane per direction); 21 stations; 2 terminals (Kim Ma and Yen Nghia); one depot at Yen Nghia; 10 pedestrian overpasses; 35 BRT vehicles; and traffic signals.The BRT line began operation on January 1, 2017. In the first month, passengers could ride the BRT free of charge. Now, a one-way ticket costs VND 7,000 (about US$0.3).The core benefits of the Hanoi BRT were identified by estimating the difference in passenger travel time and vehicle operating cost (VOC) after its operation started, compared to the before. The benefits were valued based on the willingness of users to pay time-cost and VOC per trip, with new trips generated assumed to have a uniformly distributed ‘willingness to pay’ ranging from just below the per-trip cost without the project and that with the project.The BRT has been operating with a service frequency of one bus every 5 minutes (each direction) during peak hours, 7 minutes during daytime off-peak hours, and every 10 minutes in the evening. Approximately 14,000 people use the service each day, 80% of whom are students and office workers. According to the Hanoi Department of Transport, 23% of riders have switched to using BRT from their private vehicles. The BRT system has helped to increase urban mobility in targeted areas of the city, promoting more environmentally sustainable transport modes. It increased the use of public transport in selected traffic corridors and reduced travel time between the center and the west and northwest sections of Hanoi.<strong>What are the CO2 reduction achievements?</strong>The principal GHG emissions reduction comes from reduced car and motorcycle trips. The total GHG emissions reduction estimated until 2025 is 122,177 tons of CO2e.<strong>Next Steps:  </strong>From the results and lessons learnt from the first BRT project, the Hanoi city has been considering to invest in a second BRT route from Kim Ma to High tech Hoa Lac. The High tech area has over 20,000 active commuters, including government officials, industrial workers and students. 24 out of 35 BRT buses will be used for BRT route 1, and the remaining for the BRT route 2.<strong>Links to further information</strong><a href="https://www.myhanoitours.com/hanoi-bus-rapid-transit-brt/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hanoi Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)</a><strong>Contact Details</strong>Ms. NgaHanoi Urban transport development Project (HUTDP)Tel. +84982042807<a href="mailto:hutdppmu@vnn.vn">hutdppmu@vnn.vn</a>

Hanoi - Households Emissions Reduction through Cookstove Conversions
#################################################################################

            December 2018        In Hanoi alone, there are over 50,000 households which have been using inefficient Beehive stoves for various purposes like cooking, food & drink services and cattle feed. The exposure to smoke poses significant health risks, particularly for women and children. Considering that households spend more than two hours a day cooking, health hazards are ever so likely. The WHO estimates that short and long-term health effects associated with the smoke produced by these fuels have contributed to approximately 45,000 deaths per year in the country.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA0OTYgNjYzIiB3aWR0aD0iNDk2IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjY2MyIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyMDU3X0JlZWhpdmVfU3RvdmUub3JpZ2luYWwuanBnJTNGMTU0NTA1MTkwNCIgZGF0YS13PSI0OTYiIGRhdGEtaD0iNjYzIiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4=">Picture of an old beehive cookstove</img>The traditional fuel used for beehive stoves in Hanoi is what is called “beehive coal”. Beehive coal is similar to conventional coal but is mixed with mud and other substances. When burning, it emits a number of hazardous substances.The beehive stoves conversion into advanced clean cookstoves (see pictures below) leads to burning of biomass rather than fossil fuels, which contributes to GHG reduction. The clean cookstoves have also been checked and tested by ‘Smart Development Works Vietnam’ (SNV Vietnam) against efficiency, emissions, safety and fuel savings international standards. These advanced clean cookstoves have greater heating efficiency and need less fuel, therefore emit less CO2 and particles, reducing harmful impacts on user’s health.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA2NTIgMzM1IiB3aWR0aD0iNjUyIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjMzNSIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyMDU4X1NjcmVlbl9TaG90XzIwMTgtMTItMTdfYXRfMTMuMDQuMzEub3JpZ2luYWwucG5nJTNGMTU0NTA1MTkxNSIgZGF0YS13PSI2NTIiIGRhdGEtaD0iMzM1IiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4="/><strong>What is the innovation? How does it work?</strong>To improve the quality of the urban environment and citizens’ health, Hanoi has committed to eliminate beehive stoves by 2020, encouraging citizens to use innovative stoves which are fuel efficient, have less carbon emissions, and benefit users’ health and safety.Since April 2017, the city assessed the cookstove usage status in every district of Hanoi by assessing users’ habits and demands, so that policies and financial mechanisms can be proposed for incentives for conversion to innovative stoves.Statistics show that cookstoves are used mainly in middle and high-income areas. Awareness of cookstoves’ impacts is limited among local people. Only 14-30% of cookstove users want to replace traditional cookstoves with cleaner ones. Most of the interviewees did not know about advanced cookstoves with a lower price. This is why researchers, local and international NGOs and civil society have been working together to tackle the issue. Thanks to an effective network and awareness-raising campaigns, many Hanoi inhabitants now have clean cookstoves that drastically reduce smoke levels and carbon emissions.At present, SNV Vietnam has provided financial support for qualified clean cookstove producers in order to promote clean advanced cookstoves across the country, including Hanoi.Hanoi will continue to work with SNV Vietnam to increase access to and availability of advanced clean cookstoves for households, while increasing the capacity of local producers to distribute clean cookstoves.<strong>What are the CO2 reduction goals?</strong>According to estimates, it is possible to achieve emission reductions of up to 3,667 million tons of CO2 by replacing all Hanoi’s 50,000 fossil fuel-burning cookstoves with cleaner stoves burning biomass.<strong>Contact Details</strong>Le Thanh ThuyHanoi Environmental Protection Agency<a href="mailto:thuyle.epa@gmail.com">thuyle.epa@gmail.com</a>

The population of the greater urban area is about 7.5 million (2015), and is expected to grow to more than 8 million by 2025. Private vehicles dominate transportation, with about 90% of transport modal share. Inadequate road infrastructure results in heavy congestion during peak hours, and this is getting worse as motorbike riders switch to cars when their household income improves.While the road network is expanding slowly, the growth cannot meet the expected increase in demand, and most inner city areas face space limitations on road capacity expansion. Private transport is not sustainable as the principal transportation mode. A well-integrated high capacity public urban transport system is essential to meet the demands of Hanoi, and a metro rail system is the most appropriate solution for densely populated inner city areas.Without investment in major public transport infrastructures to support a significant modal shift to public transport, economic growth will be severely constrained and the urban environment will deteriorate due to high logistics costs and severe congestion. Hanoi is at an early stage of adoption of private motorization, so investments in major public transport infrastructures represent an effective mean to reduce future urban congestion and lower carbon emissions.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA2MzcgNjE2IiB3aWR0aD0iNjM3IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjYxNiIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyMDU0X01ldHJvMS5vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmclM0YxNTQ0NzkzMDc2IiBkYXRhLXc9IjYzNyIgZGF0YS1oPSI2MTYiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/><strong>What is the project?</strong>The Project will develop an integrated public transport system in six districts (four urban and two sub-urban) of Hanoi that will support effective utilization of the city’s Metro Line 3. Improved public transport will greatly enhance access, as well as support the Hanoi Urban Transport Master Plan’s (HUTMP) objective of increasing public transport ridership of over 40%, reducing dependency on private vehicles.This program is one of the five major interventions under the Vietnam Country Investment Plan (CIP). The CIP was first endorsed by the Trust Fund Committee in December 2009, and later revised and endorsed again in 2013. The revised CIP reallocates Clean Technology Fund (CTF) financing to include an additional $50 million to the Hanoi Sustainable Urban Transport (SUT) Program on top of the original $50 million. The SUT is fully consistent with the Government of Vietnam’s policy framework for climate change, energy security, and environmental management. It is aligned also with the Asian Development Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Vietnam, focusing on improving institutional, financial and operational efficiency of transport infrastructure, and road safety. The HUTMP focuses on the development of the Metro Line 3, along with four other metro lines (i.e. MRT Line 1, 2, 2A, and BRT Line 1), as priority interventions facilitating access to public transport. This will consequently help to tackle the transport sector’s high share of CO2 emissions, which almost doubled from 14 percent in 1980 to 25 percent in 2011.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA2MTYgMzI5IiB3aWR0aD0iNjE2IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjMyOSIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyMDU1X1NjcmVlbl9TaG90XzIwMTgtMTItMTRfYXRfMTMuMTAuNDMub3JpZ2luYWwucG5nJTNGMTU0NDc5MzA5MSIgZGF0YS13PSI2MTYiIGRhdGEtaD0iMzI5IiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4="/><strong>How does it work?</strong>The SUT comprises two investment operations: The ‘Hanoi Metro Rail System Line 3: Nhon – Ha Noi station section’ (Project 1), which will develop a new double track metro rail line, including stations and depot facilities, and electrical and mechanical systems; and the ‘Strengthening Sustainable Urban Transport for Metro Line 3’ (Project 2), which will implement sustainable transport measures. The detailed design of Project 1 was completed in March 2012. In June 2012, the Government of Vietnam signed the CTF project preparation grant of $1 million. CTF funds will co-finance accessibility measures, public transport information systems, and sector development and implementation support. The total cost is almost $1.54 billion.Competitive metro rail services and improved integration of Metro Line 3 stations with other transportation is expected. Project 1 will achieve operational Metro Line 3 and improved capacity of Ha Noi Metropolitan Railway Management Board (MRB). Project 2 will establish improved accessibility features at Metro Line 3 stations, including construction of pedestrian subways and footbridges, bus stops and feeder links, and waiting areas for public transport service providers. A station access management system will be installed to facilitate efficient flow of people and traffic around the metro. What are the CO2 reduction goals/achievements? While the overall goal is to develop a public traffic network citywide, supporting sustainably the city’s economic  growth and efficiency, the Metro line operation is also expected to mitigate up to 20,000 tCO2eq/year.<strong>Next Steps</strong>Enforcement measures will be improved to ensure clear pedestrian access and smooth traffic flow, and to manage private vehicle parking around the Metro. Integrated and innovative public transport services and measures connecting metro stations will be developed. Public transport policy will be improved, including station access management system and enforcement measures, station parking policy, public transport ticketing framework, pricing of public and private transport, and capacity development and training to transport agencies.<strong>Links to further information</strong><a href="https://www.afd.fr/fr/ligne-ndeg3-de-metro-de-hanoi-nhon-gare-de-hanoi" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hanoi's Metro Line – Agence Française de Dévelopment</a><strong>Contact Details</strong>Ms. NgaHanoi Metropolitan Railway Management Board (MRB)+84 982042807<a href="mailto:hutdppmu@vnn.vn">hutdppmu@vnn.vn</a>

The small spaces left between the bundles and the saltmarsh edges are filled with sediment that is quickly colonized by vegetation, which in turn consolidates them, thus effectively reconstructing new saltmarsh areas.The wood to create bundles was supplied free of charge and obtained from routine forest management activities (such as pruning) carried out in in the lagoon and its mainland.  The waste generated by the management of wooded areas thus became a valuable resource to be transported just a short distance away with the added plus of both reduced costs and reduced CO2 emissions. Jobs for local residents from around the lagoon were also created.The involvement of local communities and stakeholders, due to their bond with the territory and knowledge of its dynamics, could make the project even more sustainable in the long term.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA5NDYgNjIyIiB3aWR0aD0iOTQ2IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjYyMiIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyMDUyX1NhbHRtYXJzaGVzMi5vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmclM0YxNTQ0NzIxMzU1IiBkYXRhLXc9Ijk0NiIgZGF0YS1oPSI2MjIiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/><strong>What are the CO2 reduction goals?</strong>The surface occupied by saltmarshes (green areas) has drastically decreased from 158 square kilometers in 1912 to only 40 square kilometers today. The green lungs of Venice’s lagoon are in peril and carbon dioxide absorption decreases proportionally to the loss of green areas. This project aims to protect and remodel these important habitats.<strong>Next Steps</strong>This pilot project was financed by the European Community for four years from 2013 to 2017. A protocol of agreement to implement this integrated approach for the maintenance of this worksite and other fragile parts of the Venice lagoon is foreseen between the City of Venice, the ‘Provveditorato alle Opere Pubbliche’ (the Local Public Works Superintendence), the University of Padua, the Veneto Region and the 'Consorzio di Bonifica Acque Risorgive' (the local Drainage Consortium).<strong>Links to further information</strong><a href="http://www.lifevimine.eu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LIFE VIMINE official website</a><a href="https://www.comune.venezia.it/it/content/life-vimine-progetto-la-protezione-delle-barene" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LIFE VIMINE: Progetto Europeo per la Protezione delle Barene</a><a href="http://www.atlantedellalaguna.it/?q=node/208" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Progetto LIFE VIMINE</a><strong>Contact Details</strong>Claudia FerrariDepartment of Strategic and Environmental ProjectsCity of Venice<a href="mailto:servizio.ambiente@comune.venezia.it">servizio.ambiente@comune.venezia.it</a>Luca PalmeriDepartment of Industrial EngineeringUniversity of Padua<a href="mailto:lifevimine@dii.unipd.it">lifevimine@dii.unipd.it</a><a href="mailto:lpalmeri@unipd.it">lpalmeri@unipd.it</a>

Mayor Rafael Greca delivered in the Santa Cândida neighborhood a social housing solar project, comprising of 26 houses equipped with photovoltaic panels – which transform sunlight into electric energy for domestic use.“Curitiba reaches 325 years with its eyes on the future. Solar energy is here to stay. These units are the first of thousands that we intend to implement this year” – said Mayor Rafael Greca, “the Cohab Solar project brings advantages to the residents, who will save on the electricity bill and also to the environment, because it uses clean and renewable energy”.The 26 housing units are part of the Faxinal Housing project developed in Santa Cândida, and are intended for low-income households.Each dwelling has been provided with a panel of 2×1 meters. The composite glass and silicon plates capture the solar radiation and send it to a converter, which then turns sunlight into electrical energy for home use. The production capacity of the system installed in each dwelling is up to 120 kWh per month.“A cloudy day like today in Curitiba has more sunlight than any sunny day in Germany, which is a reference country in photovoltaic energy. When we use clean energy we are helping not to heat the planet. Every time the world heats up, the volume of rainfall increases. Our Curitiba will do its part for the environment”, Greca said.By combining the promotion of renewable energy with addressing social issues, this project has a large potential for scale-up in the city.

How does it work?</strong>A green corridor is being formed throughout one of the most important avenues in the city – Avenue Afrânio Peixoto, known as “Suburbana”. In total, 1,520 trees will now be part of the landscape across the 14km-long avenue, a number that surpassed the initial goal of 1,400 seedlings.Launched in March 2018, the 5-month long project was delivered already, three months before the original deadline. Native species, such as ipês, sibipirunas, paus-brasil, paus-ferro, jacarandás and oitis are among the tree species that will be now growing in the area. “Our objective with this large planting, is to give more quality of life for those who live in the suburban areas, show value of the Brazilian flora – especially the Atlantic forest biome – and give preference to species that are more adapted to our soil and climate.From an aesthetic point of view, we will only see the results in about four to five years, when the trees will have large canopies and provide shadow. But the environmental result is already a reality”, highlights André Fraga, the Secretary of Sustainable City. ‘Suburbana Verde’ is part of the Program “Salvador Capital of the Atlantic Forest”, which aims to promote afforestation in the city prioritizing native species. Teams from the Secretariat visited the neighbourhoods close to the project, to promote awareness and local ‘ownership’ of the newly planted trees. Local residents and business owners received information about the importance of urban afforestation, the benefits of the project, and necessary caretaking measures for the seedlings.

It identifies the applicable legislation, criteria pollutants as well as the sectors and strategic stakeholders that have collaborated to ensure robust implementation over the next five years. Key Performance Indicators undergo periodic review to ensure their relevance to the overall strategic goals, and sectoral plans, policies, and initiatives.<strong>What is the policy? </strong><img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA3NTYgMjMwIiB3aWR0aD0iNzU2IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjIzMCIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyMDQ4X1NjcmVlbl9TaG90XzIwMTgtMTItMTNfYXRfMTMuMDAuMzUub3JpZ2luYWwucG5nJTNGMTU0NDcwNzA0NyIgZGF0YS13PSI3NTYiIGRhdGEtaD0iMjMwIiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4="/>The assessment of current and future scenarios and associated risks was based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of the air pollutants emitted by operational and manufacturing activities of all viable sectors in Dubai. The considered criteria pollutants are carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM), which all adversely affect human health particularly the respiratory system.The Air Quality Strategy sets out annual emission reduction targets from 2017 through 2021. A target of 8% emission load reduction across all sectors was set for 2017, gradually increasing to 22% reduction by 2021. The aim in 2017 was to achieve 87% clean air days increasing to 90% clean air days by 2021.<strong>What are the emissions reduction achievements?</strong>A review of the performance of the Air Quality Strategy on its first year of implementation showed that the overall target has been achieved with a total emission load reduction of 8.6%, which is beyond the 8% target. The achieved reduction in emissions per pollutant was 7% for NO2, 6% for SO2 and 13% for PM10.The achieved reduction is a result of the collective efforts of all stakeholders. Reduction in emissions from the Road Transport Authority is mainly attributed to the commissioning of hybrid taxis, the Dubai Green Mobility Initiative, the reduction of public buses fuel consumption through biofuel use and avoiding engine idling among others, and expansion of the public transport such as the metro and tram.Emissions reduction in the Aviation sector was realized through the efforts of the Airport Environmental Action Group led by the Dubai Airports.The implementation of the Solar Park Project, procurement of hybrid vehicles, and energy and water saving initiatives have all contributed to the reduction of emissions from the Maritime Sector.Dubai Electricity and Water Authority has reduced its emissions through the implementation of emission reduction technologies in the power plants, equipment efficiency improvement, increased capacity of solar power plant, energy and water saving programs, among others.Retrofitting and upgrade to low-emission technologies, use of low-sulfur or cleaner fuel, process optimization have been implemented by various industrial facilities.Initiatives from support stakeholders that played a role in the reduction of emissions towards the improvement of air quality include installation of vapor recovery systems in petrol filling stations, launch of clean fuel (Biodiesel 5), and development of fuel specifications and standards. Similarly, Dubai Municipality’s Car-Free Day, Carbon Abatement Strategy 2021 and environmental awareness programs of government and private entities have all contributed to reduced emissions in Dubai.These reductions in emission loads were manifested in the improvement of air quality in Dubai, which is actively monitored through the Dubai Municipality’s Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Network. In 2017, Dubai has attained 87.6% clean air days exceeding the target of 87% and showing an increase from the 87% clean air days reported in 2016. This increase in clean air days provides an indication of a promising path towards the achievement of the national target of 90% clean air days by 2021.<strong>Next Steps </strong>Initiatives from lead and supporting stakeholders to be implemented in the forthcoming years are already laid out in the Strategy. It is notable to mention DM’s plan of expanding the monitoring network and deploying the Air Environment Mobile Station to support the Air Quality Strategy. The commitment of the government and all other stakeholders to implement these initiatives is vital to the success of this Strategy.<strong>Links to further information</strong><a href="http://www.dubaiairenvironment.dm.gov.ae/menu/airqualitystrategy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dubai Air Quality Strategy</a>

This led to the adoption of the City’s Green Roof Bylaw and the Eco-Roof Incentive Program in 2009.<strong>What is the innovation? How does it work?</strong><strong>Green Roof Bylaw</strong>Toronto was the first city in North America to have a bylaw to require and govern the construction of green roofs on new developments. The Green Roof Bylaw sets out a graduated green roof requirement for new developments that are greater than 2,000 m² in gross floor area. The requirement ranges from 20-60% of the available roof space of a building. The Bylaw includes an option for developers to seek approval to pay $200/m<strong>Eco-Roof Incentive Program</strong>Toronto's Eco-Roof Incentive Program encourages the installation of green roofs and cool roofs on existing (and some new) buildings through financial incentives. The program offers $100/m<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup><strong>Green Roof Construction Standard</strong>Whether constructing a green roof voluntarily, or as required by the Green Roof Bylaw, all green roofs in Toronto, at a minimum, must conform to the Toronto Green Roof Construction Standard. The purpose of the Standard is to govern the design and construction of green roofs by setting out minimum requirements that meet the City’s objective.<strong>What are the achievements?</strong>Between 2010 and 2017, approximately 420 green roof permits were issued in Toronto, totaling 450,000 square meters of green roof space. The Eco-Roof Incentive Program has received over 500 applications and successfully supported 336 eco-roof projects since 2009. Achievements of projects funded through the Eco-Roof Incentive Program are summarized in the table below.Area of ConcernOutcomesStormwater ManagementApproximately 11 million liters of storm water diverted from sewers annually, resulting in a cost saving of at least $100,000.Energy EfficiencyAverage of 1000 megawatt hours per year in energy savings primarily from reduced need for air conditioning.Greenhouse Gas Emission Reductions/Air QualityAverage of 220 metric tons of greenhouse gases avoided annually.Green Space Enhancement and BiodiversityGreen roofs will help increase green space in the urban environment with the potential to enhance biodiversity.Economic DevelopmentMinimum of 12 person-years of new employment generated.Urban Heat Island MitigationWidespread implementation of green roofs can reduce local ambient air temperature 1.5 to 2°C, with a direct 4-5°C temperature roof surface cooling effect.Note: Data is only available for projects funded through the Eco-Roof Incentive Program at this time.<strong>Next Steps</strong>The Green Roof Bylaw and the Eco-Roof Incentive Program are key components for implementing Toronto's ‘Such policies are also designed to manage the quantity and improve the quality of stormwater; to reduce GHG emissions, promote green infrastructure to complement infrastructure, and to encourage green roofs as an innovative approach to reducing the urban heat island effect. They address multiple city-wide environmental policy objectives including The City of Toronto plans to continue to undertake consultation with stakeholders on a regular basis, including the roofing industry, to ensure the program and policies remain relevant.<strong>Links to further information</strong><a href="https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/official-plan-guidelines/green-roofs/green-roof-bylaw/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Green Roof Bylaw</a><a href="https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/water-environment/environmental-grants-incentives-2/green-your-roof/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eco-Roof Incentive Program</a><strong>Contact Details</strong>Eco-Roof Incentive ProgramAnnemarie BayntonT: 416-392-1848E: Green Roof BylawShayna StottT: 416-392-0171E:

            December 2018        As one of Auckland’s largest infrastructure construction projects, the City Rail Link (CRL) identified significant opportunities to embed carbon reduction early in the planning process.  To maximise these opportunities, the project team adopted the  Infrastructure Sustainability (IS) rating framework by the Infrastructure Sustainability Council of Australia. Under the IS framework, the CRL was awarded a “leading” rating for the design and construction planning of the first two CRL work packages: construction of the Britomart and Albert Street tunnels. As part of this Leading rating, CRL was specifically recognised for its pioneering work integrating Mana Whenua<sup>1</sup><img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA3MzEgNTUwIiB3aWR0aD0iNzMxIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjU1MCIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyMDQyX0F1Y2tsYW5kX3JhaWxfbGlua18xLm9yaWdpbmFsLnBuZyUzRjE1NDQ0NDY5MDIiIGRhdGEtdz0iNzMxIiBkYXRhLWg9IjU1MCIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+"/><strong>What innovations are associated with the project?</strong>In addition to improving access to most parts of the city center and major employment areas, the City Rail Link is expected to promote substantial redevelopment around the station precincts.The CRL also has a zero waste to landfill goal through construction, and so far the first two work packages have achieved 98% diversion from landfill for construction and demolition waste, 81% diversion for spoil, and 75% for office waste.In addition, CRL is using its procurement process to create pathways for quality employment with a focus on skills legacy, apprenticeships and new jobs for those facing barriers to employment. The CRL build will create about 1,60e0 jobs throughout the life of the construction. Contractors are being asked to provide internships, cadetships, apprenticeships or equivalent pathways to learning as well as upskilling and reskilling to equip people for the present and future.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA3MzkgNDQ1IiB3aWR0aD0iNzM5IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjQ0NSIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYyMDQzX0F1Y2tsYW5kX3JhaWxfbGlua18yLm9yaWdpbmFsLnBuZyUzRjE1NDQ0NDY5MTEiIGRhdGEtdz0iNzM5IiBkYXRhLWg9IjQ0NSIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+"/><strong>What are the CO2 reduction goals?</strong>Construction energy savings for the first two work packages are projected to avoid 2,393 tonnes of CO2e emissions (a 29% reduction from baseline) while operational savings from energy efficiency initiatives at Britomart, once the CRL is running, are expected to equate to nearly 15,000 tonnes of CO2e emissions over its lifetime.The CRL’s 3.45km of twin tunnels will turn the downtown Britomart Transport Centre from a one-way terminus into a two-way through-station, and the construction of two more city stations will better connect the Auckland rail network.<strong>Links to further information</strong><a href="https://www.cityraillink.co.nz/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">City rail Link website</a><a href="http://ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/articles/news/2017/11/15-more-trains-for-auckland/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">More trains for Auckland</a><a href="http://ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/articles/news/2017/08/20-million-rail-trips-in-12-months/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">20 million train trips</a><a href="http://ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/articles/news/2017/07/auckland-council-agrees-to-new-electric-trains/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">New electric trains</a><strong>Contact Details</strong>Ghida SinawiSustainability ManagerCity Rail Link Project+64 9 304 1382<a href="mailto:ghida.sinawi@cityraillink.govt.nz">ghida.sinawi@cityraillink.govt.nz</a>

It is a clear statement that Auckland is committed to investing in low emissions technology and protecting our environment.<strong>What is the innovation? How does it work?</strong>Auckland Council has obtained certification for the Green Bonds from the Climate Bonds Initiative. The certification means that the Green Bonds meet the criteria set out in the Climate Bonds Standard. All Council’s investments are intended to generate long-term, positive environmental, social and/or economic outcomes for the region. However, issuing a green bond adds a level of rigour and verification that the outcomes we achieve through our investments are ‘green’. The process of defining and selecting green assets for inclusion in the green bond portfolio is independently verified, as are the positive environmental outcomes delivered by these assets.<strong>What are the CO2 reduction goals?</strong>Auckland Council’s 10-year Budget and the <strong>Next Steps</strong>Green bonds will allow Auckland Council to diversify the pool of funds available by bringing in investors who wish to fund ‘green’ infrastructure assets and projects.Auckland Mayor Phil Goff says, “Auckland must be an environmental leader and with billions of dollars being invested in Auckland’s infrastructure over the coming decade, we are embracing an environmentally friendly way to generate revenue and protect our environment as our city grows”.<strong>Links to Further Information</strong><a href="http://ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/articles/news/2018/6/green-bond-issue-a-success-with-200-million-raised-for-electric-trains/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Green bond issue a success</a><a href="http://ourauckland.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/articles/media/council/2018/03/auckland-council-gives-green-light-for-green-bonds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Green light for green bonds</a><a href="https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/about-auckland-council/business-in-auckland/Documents%20%20Green%20Bond%202018/green-bond-framework-9-may-2018.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Auckland Council Green Bond Framework</a><a href="https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/plans-projects-policies-reports-bylaws/our-plans-strategies/auckland-plan/about-the-auckland-plan/docsprintdocuments/auckland-plan-2050-print-document.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Auckland Plan 2050</a><strong>Contact Details</strong>Alec TangCEnv MIEMAPrincipal Specialist Corporate SustainabilityChief Sustainability OfficeAuckland Council<a href="mailto:alec.tang@aucklandcouncil.govt.nz">alec.tang@aucklandcouncil.govt.nz</a><a href="http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz</a>

Addis Ababa’s ‘Megenagna Smart Parking’ as an Instrument to Reduce GHG Emissions, Improve Air Quality, and Reduce Traffic Jams
#################################################################################

            December 2018        <img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyMDAwIDE1MDAiIHdpZHRoPSIyMDAwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjE1MDAiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYzQwLm9yZyUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZzdGF0aWMlMkZvdGhlcl91cGxvYWRzJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGMjAzNV9pbWFnZTMub3JpZ2luYWwuanBlZyUzRjE1NDQxOTM0NDYiIGRhdGEtdz0iMjAwMCIgZGF0YS1oPSIxNTAwIiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4="/>Addis Ababa’s parking system is mainly dominated by on-street parking, although there are a few off-street parking areas or parking spaces inside buildings. However, there are no readily accessible parking areas near public transport terminals, which contribute to the inefficient utilization of the road network, especially in terms of road users’ safety and traffic congestion. This, in turn, contributes to higher carbon emissions from vehicles and further impacts on air quality. Addis Ababa’s Transport Programs Management Office (TPMO) is making efforts to solve parking issues through the development of optimized parking systems, particularly with the construction of smart parking systems equipped with modern devices, such as cameras and sensors.The<strong>What does the project consist of? What’s the innovation?</strong>There are several smart parking systems being built in Addis Ababa. The ‘Megenagna Smart Parking’ (MSP) is fully operating since June 2017, and is considered as a continental first, and is the first smart parking facility constructed within this new city’s mobility management plan. It connects six road junctures convening from different parts of the capital, and its aim is to alleviate the pressure on the surrounding road network. Megenagna was selected as the pilot location, as it is a central hub for many economic activities, such as markets, mall, shops and hotels, and therefore very prone to traffic and pedestrian congestion.The MSP consists of a 15-storey facility spreading over an area of 170 square meters, and with construction cost of 40 million Birr (≈ USD 1.5 million). It has been financed by the Government of Ethiopia and constructed jointly by Dayang Auto-parking Equipment Co. Ltd., a Chinese smart parking manufacturing company, and a local electro-mechanical works contractor, SYSPROEN Systems and Engineering Ltd. It has the capacity to accommodate a total of 140 cars, out of which 50 will directly on the ground floor. The preserved area around the parking site could also accommodate 70 more cars, tallying up the total ground floor’s car capacity to 120. The Smart Megenagna Parking has a modern lifting system that safely parks cars in a huge steel storey building.This smart parking has many benefits. It contributes to GHG emissions reduction and air quality improvement by alleviating traffic congestion, through reducing time drivers need to find a free parking space. Furthermore, it also helped solve parking and traffic flow issues in the area by providing more parking slots, accompanied by policies banning street-parking in highly-congestible areas. Moreover, it presented a job opportunity for  20 people, becoming the leading example for other smart parking systems being built across the city. The simple steps in using the facilty involve payment via a credit card system; then one’s car is placed on a platform and taken up for parking. Parking prices across the facility are identical: 6 birrs for the first hour (≈ USD 0.20) and 9 birrs (≈USD 0.30) for every additional hour. As one of the parking attendants testifies, “The park has good demand throughout the day”.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyMDAwIDE1MDAiIHdpZHRoPSIyMDAwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjE1MDAiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYzQwLm9yZyUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZzdGF0aWMlMkZvdGhlcl91cGxvYWRzJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGMjAzN19pbWFnZTIub3JpZ2luYWwuanBlZyUzRjE1NDQxOTM0NzgiIGRhdGEtdz0iMjAwMCIgZGF0YS1oPSIxNTAwIiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4="/><strong>Lessons learned</strong>As explained by Mrs. Maernet G/Tsaddik, leader of the ‘Parking development, Expansion and Licensing Core’ of the TPMO, “the Megenagna Smart Parking is doing well; however, the Welosefer Ground Parking, for instance, which opened at the same time as the MSP, is not operating as expected, due to the lack of demand for parking slots in that area”. Therefore, the main challenge of Addis Ababa’s smart parking revolution is that some of the sites allocated in the city’s master plan are situated in low traffic and suburb areas, with low parking demand, or in central areas where it is very difficult to undertake parking construction. The City of Addis is thus working on relocating some sites not feasible as per the master plan, so that parking demand and parking sites offer match. To this extent, the MSP experience is very crucial.<strong>Links to further information</strong><a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/3d63544d3049444e/share_p.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ethiopia Introduces First Smart Parking System in Africa (Video)</a><a href="https://www.c40.org/wp-content/static/other_uploads/images/2036_Addis_Ababa_Structural_Plan_2017_to_2027.original.pdf?1544193458" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Addis Ababa's Master Plan</a>Contact DetailsTibebu AssefaAddis AbabaEthiopia<a href="mailto:tassefa@c40.org">tassefa@c40.org</a>

Electricity is generated from 43.1% coal, 21.4% natural gas, 26.8% nuclear, 1.8% oil, 5.6% renewables and 1.3% hydroelectricity. The power sector in South Korea is vertically integrated, and is controlled by the state-owned Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO). The government proposed a partial privatisation of the sector in 2016 to increase competition in power generation and distribution, although the timeframe is undetermined. The majority of their energy is still obtained from fossil fuels, with <7% from renewable sources, mostly hydropower and biomass.The need for Seoul to reform their energy policy became apparent in 2011 after the city experienced a major blackout and due to public pressure to phase out nuclear plants after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (nuclear power provides 26.8% of South Korea’s power). The Seoul Metropolitan Government has been implementing the One Less Nuclear Power Plant Project since April 2012 to increase energy self-sufficiency and reduce energy use.Seoul is also trying to resolve the inconveniences suffered by residents living near nuclear power plants or thermal power plants through implementation of mutual growth projects and cooperative projects in partnership with other local governments. The achievements of One Less Nuclear Power Plant (2012-2017) were identified as a reduction in energy consumption of 4.65 MTOE, whilst the independence rate grew from 2.9% to 5%.<strong>Solution to the Problem</strong>The first phase of the energy policy was launched in April 2012 with a target of reducing 2 million TOE of energy, an amount of energy that corresponds to the power generation of one nuclear power plant. The city designated 71 project areas under energy generation, energy efficiency and energy saving. The policy gained widespread support from the public, and the target was reached 6 months early, with electricity use falling by 4% by 2014 compared to 2011.The second phase of the energy policy started in July 2014 with bigger visions and values. The targets are to reach 20% electricity self-reliance rate, cut greenhouse gas emissions by 10 million tons and reduce energy use by 4 million TOE compared to 2011 levels3. The city aims to realise the three energy values – energy self-reliance, sharing, and participation – through institutional improvements and citizen participation, where citizens themselves produce and consume energy efficiently.The project has engaged citizens and changed their perception of energy. Around 1.88 million people have joined the Eco-mileage program, which incentivises members’ energy saving behaviours. Some 20,000 students from 500 schools have become ‘Energy Guardian Angles’ to practice energy-saving at home and at school. In addition, 20,000 buildings and houses took part in the Building Retrofit Project, and 9.60 million lights were replaced with eco-friendly, high energy-efficient LED bulbs.In addition, Seoul is trying to resolve the inconveniences suffered by residents living near nuclear power plants or thermal power plants through implementation of mutual growth projects and cooperative projects, such as the construction of solar power plants, in partnership with other local governments.<strong>Public engagement:</strong>For over six months the Executive Committee, formed of 48 advisors and experts from academia, businesses, and civic groups, held social fiction conferences and public discussions to listen to the opinions of citizens. Online surveys were also conducted to collect public opinions, and the Seoul International Energy Advisory Council submitted their recommendations on the second phase as well.In February 2017, Seoul Energy Corporation was launched to supervise the capital’s energy policies. It is distributing a manual of the One Less Nuclear Power Plant Project and spreading its energy saving know-how. Social promotion has been encouraged through creative and consistent calligraphic style between the two phases.The Corporation will also spread the value of mutual growth and realize energy democracy in cooperation with other local governments. In conjunction with the local communities, it will carry out a variety of new and renewable energy projects, and produce and distribute the manual of the One Less Nuclear Power Plant Project to other local governments.The potential challenges in the success of this programme is the uptake of policies by the public and engagement by community groups. The Executive Director of the Sun and Wind Energy Cooperative noted, “Since these projects are absolutely dependent on civic participation, we hope to see more policies for supporting energy cooperatives and specific plans for civic participation”.<strong>Links to further Information</strong><a href="http://english.seoul.go.kr/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Seoul-Sustainable-Energy-Action-Plan_brochure.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">One Less Nuclear Power Plant Phase 2 – Brochure</a><strong>Contact Details</strong>Chul Woong ChoiDeputy Director / Head of One Less Nuclear Power PlantENvironmental Policy Division

            December 2018        Mayor of Rio de Janeiro – Marcelo Crivella – presented on June 5th (World Environment Day), the three 100% electric vehicles of COMLURB (the municipal company of urban cleaning) that are being used in the collection of biological waste in municipal hospitals. The vehicles are environmentally sustainable, with zero emissions of greenhouse gases, and produce very low noise. They have 750 kg load capacity and a lifetime five times higher than fossil fuel vehicles.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMTUyIDY0OCIgd2lkdGg9IjExNTIiIGhlaWdodD0iNjQ4IiBkYXRhLXU9Imh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGd3d3LmM0MC5vcmclMkZ3cC1jb250ZW50JTJGc3RhdGljJTJGb3RoZXJfdXBsb2FkcyUyRmltYWdlcyUyRjIwMTNfQ29tbHVyYl8yLm9yaWdpbmFsLmpwZyUzRjE1NDM4NDQ3MzEiIGRhdGEtdz0iMTE1MiIgZGF0YS1oPSI2NDgiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/>“In the second half of the year, we will start to change our fleet of residential waste collection trucks. The fleet will receive electric vehicles, until all of them are like this. They will reduce city’s costs and, above all, will raise the health quality of our citizens” said Crivella.These electric vans are used to collect hospital waste across the five largest municipal public network units: Souza Aguiar (Center), Miguel Couto (Gávea), Salgado Filho (Méier), Hospital-Maternidade Leila Diniz and Lourenço Jorge (both in Barra da Tijuca).“COMLURB is always looking for innovations, savings are considerable. In addition to the longer lifetime, electric vans represent one-fifth of the cost of a combustion-powered car”, according to the president of the company, Tarquínio Prisco.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyMDAwIDEzMzMiIHdpZHRoPSIyMDAwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEzMzMiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYzQwLm9yZyUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZzdGF0aWMlMkZvdGhlcl91cGxvYWRzJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGMjAxNF9Db21sdXJiX3Zhbi5vcmlnaW5hbC5qcGclM0YxNTQzODQ0NzU2IiBkYXRhLXc9IjIwMDAiIGRhdGEtaD0iMTMzMyIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+"/><strong>What is the innovation? How does it work?</strong>By producing virtually no noise, vehicles can operate in residential areas at night. The recharge of the batteries takes place in the COMLURB depot in Bangu, in the West Zone of Rio. It takes 120 minutes to fully recharge and they have an autonomy of 250 km, with an average speed in urban areas of 50 km/h.

            November 2018        Significant flooding issues affected a 1.3 kilometre section of the stream, in an area that was slated for greater intensification under the Auckland Unitary Plan. To overcome these issues, the Auckland Council replaced the existing concrete channel with a wider, naturalised stream channel. The use of plants – native trees, ferns and flaxes – increased the water-carrying capacity of the watercourse and provided greater potential for stormwater to naturally soak into the ground.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA5MzcgNjI1IiB3aWR0aD0iOTM3IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjYyNSIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYxOTk5X09ha2xleV9DcmVla18xLm9yaWdpbmFsLnBuZyUzRjE1NDMzMjY5NjkiIGRhdGEtdz0iOTM3IiBkYXRhLWg9IjYyNSIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+"/><strong>What is the innovation? How does it work?</strong>The project exemplifies best practice by anticipating climate change and population growth, enabling greater urban intensification in an existing flood plain and building a future-focused resilience to climate change impacts. The use of green infrastructure techniques has reduced the effects of flooding on surrounding areas and provides natural filtration and cleaning of collected stormwater.The community was extensively engaged in the planning process, and the scope of the project includes not just flood mitigation aspects but new cycle paths, walking trails, play spaces, a community center, an outdoor classroom, and a beginners’ BMX track, in the reserves bordering the creek. Massive community-carved swamp kauri stumps were repurposed in the interactive play areas and traditional Māori games area. This prevented large amounts of wood being sent to landfill and allowed construction at a fraction of the cost of a typical playground.An objective of the project was to use social procurement to deliver social and economic outcomes over and above the infrastructural improvements. A youth employment initiative involved a multi-skills training certificate, provision of mentoring and drivers’ license training. The initiative was designed to act as a pathway for five local employment/apprenticeship positions on the project (included as a tender requirement).The initiative has resulted in 11 young people having completed a Level 2 certificate in Multi-Skills Building Construction training programme at Unitec. Three trainees are employed at Te Auaunga site; a further 2 are working elsewhere with the contractor, and one is working with Te Whangai Trust. Another trainee gained an apprenticeship elsewhere.<strong>Next Steps</strong>The project also led to an innovative new partnership between Auckland Council, Te Whāngai Trust and Wesley Intermediate School, to create a native nursery on the school's grounds that will provide training and employment opportunities while also supplying the native plants. The nursery is required to work with 60 people per year in delivering the plants, planting and plant maintenance contract to Te Auaunga. Te Whāngai Trust’s work focuses on bringing long-term unemployed and people with mental health/offending history into sustained employment through building work and life skills.<strong>Links to further Information</strong><a href="https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/plans-projects-policies-reports-bylaws/our-plans-strategies/auckland-plan/environment-cultural-heritage/Pages/green-infrastructure.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Auckland Plan 2050: Green infrastructure</a><a href="http://knowledgeauckland.org.nz/assets/publications/Te-Auaunga-Oakley-Creek-social-evaluation-social-procurement-case-studies.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Te Auaunga (Oakley Creek) Social Evaluation: Social procurement case studies</a><significant 1.3="" a="" affected="" flooding="" issues="" kilometre="" of="" section="" stream="" the=""> <strong>Contact Details </strong></significant><significant 1.3="" a="" affected="" flooding="" issues="" kilometre="" of="" section="" stream="" the="">Tom Mansell </significant><significant 1.3="" a="" affected="" flooding="" issues="" kilometre="" of="" section="" stream="" the="">Principal Social Outcomes </significant><significant 1.3="" a="" affected="" flooding="" issues="" kilometre="" of="" section="" stream="" the="">Healthy Waters </significant><significant 1.3="" a="" affected="" flooding="" issues="" kilometre="" of="" section="" stream="" the="">Auckland Council </significant><significant 1.3="" a="" affected="" flooding="" issues="" kilometre="" of="" section="" stream="" the=""><a href="mailto:Tom.Mansell@aucklandcouncil.govt.nz ">Tom.Mansell@aucklandcouncil.govt.nz </a></significant>

Reducing GHG Emissions through Community-Driven City Clean-Ups

            November 2018        The Governor of Nairobi, H.E Mike Sonko, has put in place robust measures that have seen Nairobi residents embrace <a clean-ups="" href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001283130/sonko-declares-first-saturday-of-every-month-as-city-clean-up-day" monthly="" neighbourhoods="" their="" within=""><img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA2NjMgMzY0IiB3aWR0aD0iNjYzIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjM2NCIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYxOTk4X0NsZWFuLXVwcy5vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmclM0YxNTQzMzE1MTQwIiBkYXRhLXc9IjY2MyIgZGF0YS1oPSIzNjQiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/></a>While launching the initiative five months ago, the governor was on record stating that he would be at the forefront to ensure that the clean-ups were sustained. The concept behind these clean-ups was inspired by the idea of engaging stakeholders to ensure that they take up waste management as their own initiative. There are at least 85 clean-ups going on at the same time during the day of the ‘monthly clean-up’. Political leaders, administrators and environment officers are leading the initiative, which has been widely embraced by the residents of all the 85 wards across Nairobi.<a clean-ups="" href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001283130/sonko-declares-first-saturday-of-every-month-as-city-clean-up-day" monthly="" neighbourhoods="" their="" within=""><img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA3ODIgNTA4IiB3aWR0aD0iNzgyIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjUwOCIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYxOTk3X1NvbmtvLm9yaWdpbmFsLnBuZyUzRjE1NDMzMTUxMTkiIGRhdGEtdz0iNzgyIiBkYXRhLWg9IjUwOCIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+"/></a>To ensure sustainability, campaigns have been conducted by urging stakeholders to support the initiative. Business owners in different localities provide working tools and equipment, refreshments and branded shirts in areas within their jurisdictions. Several schools let their pupils join other stakeholders as a way of creating awareness on responsible waste management. In previous clean-ups, some State Agencies have supported the process by providing tree seedlings, used to reclaim ground that was initially used as dumping ground. All this in an effort to increase green spaces in the City, improve environmental benefits, reduce carbon emissions, improve air quality, and ultimately enhance the health of city residents.Some illegal dumpsites around the city were manned by criminal gangs. There have been positive changes in their management since the clean-ups were launched. The street urchins who used to charge levies at those grounds, have since voluntarily abandoned those areas, allowing the County Government to finally clear the accumulated waste from those sites. On its part, the County Government, in partnership with stakeholders, has planted trees in these areas as a clear indication of a change in use of such spaces. For instance, one of the areas that held over 500 loads of solid waste was the former Kangemi Cemetery, which has now been rehabilitated into a children’s playground after a successful clean-up.These clean-ups have seen the city streets and backyards cleared of garbage, and clean standards encouraged and sustained. The County Government has been able to carry out campaigns through the printing and electronic press and social media, so as to reach out as many stakeholders as possible. The Governor also reached out to the President inviting him to the October 2018 monthly clean-up at Uhuru Market in Makadara Subcounty. An invitation which the President accepted.There is plenty of hope and optimism towards having the public fully embracing the clean-ups and sustain cleanliness in the city. This program is also meant to encourage waste source separation and segregation so that Nairobi residents can view waste as a resource rather than just trash. Within a few months there has been a great increase in the number of green open spaces in the County. All this will go a long way in reducing methane gas and other greenhouse gases generated from decomposing waste and waste incineration.<strong>Links to further Information</strong><a href="https://www.nation.co.ke/video/news/4146788-4794448-dnq5c1z/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">President Kenyatta at Nairobi County Clean up (VIDEO) </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQty_ytwSqI&amp;t=15s" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Uhuru Market Clean-up exercise led by Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko (VIDEO – partially in English)</a><strong>Contact Details </strong>Phillip DingaC40 City AdviserNairobi, Kenya<a href="mailto:pdinga@c40.org">pdinga@c40.org</a>

Amsterdam’s Circular Economy Roadmap: Lessons Learned and Tools for Upscaling
#################################################################################

            November 2018        <img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxOTIwIDEyODEiIHdpZHRoPSIxOTIwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEyODEiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYzQwLm9yZyUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZzdGF0aWMlMkZvdGhlcl91cGxvYWRzJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGMTk5NF9hbXN0ZXJkYW0tMTE1MDMxOV8xOTIwLm9yaWdpbmFsLmpwZyUzRjE1NDIyNzcxODciIGRhdGEtdz0iMTkyMCIgZGF0YS1oPSIxMjgxIiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4="/>The programmes The board of Mayor and Deputy Mayors has commissioned the evaluation of This case study wants to show the lessons learned from the Amsterdam experience, and indicate which action perspectives are possible to further accelerate cities transition to a circular economy.<strong>Projects evaluation and lessons learned:</strong>The evaluation of the projects shows that the transition to a circular economy is realistic and profitable. Realistic, because the technical possibilities are great: existing projects, as well as new innovations, show that resource loops can be closed locally and are of a high quality. Profitable, because circular projects are financially more competitive than traditional projects when external costs are taken into account.From the evaluation of 73 circular projects and a validation with businesses, it becomes evident that three value chains (Construction, Biomass & Food, and Consumer goods) and two instruments (Procurement, and Research, Information provision, and Newtworks) in particular are very promising to scale up. For the sake of brevity, only these will be taken into account, but further in-depth information on the evaluation of these and other value chains and instruments are available <strong>Value chains</strong><strong>Construction value chain:</strong>Together with market parties, the Municipality of Amsterdam developed the Research, networking and the exchange of information and experiences have shown to be the most important tools in the construction chain. Market parties are willing to build in a circular way. They need clients who specifically demand circular ambitions. Every building that is constructed in a non-circular way hinders high-value reuse of building materials in the future and slows the looping of the value chain. For the near future, instruments like spatial planning policy, land issue and regulations are indispensable.<strong>Biomass &amp; food value chain:</strong>Within this chain there are several successful projects: sugar extraction from biomass in Biopark Havengebied; ammonia extraction from sewage water by Power to Protein; and phosphate extraction from urine at De Nieuwe Stroming. The municipality focuses mainly on research, networking and information exchange and, in some cases, offers financial support.The chain is often closed in a low-value manner, including the use of biomass for heat production. There is a need for scaling up initiatives that make high-value reuse possible. In addition, logistics, financing, and unclear or restrictive regulations are still obstacles for scaling up. There is a need for the deployment of spatial planning, business support, financing and regulations in order to achieve a successful upscaling of this chain.<strong>Consumer goods value chain:</strong>The municipality started supporting second-hand shops with a payment for the collection of specific products. Progress has also been made in the further development of municipal waste points to resource hubs. In addition, waste points De Pijp and Toetsenbordweg are in full preparation. The municipality is also critically examining the way in which textiles are being collected in the city (less pollution) and if by means of post-sorting a more valuable processing can be reached. Apart from municipal interventions, dozens of sharing platforms have been developed, which enable consumers to initiate a dramatic mentality shift; from valuing the possession of products, to using them. The municipal organisation itself has also taken steps towards further closing the Consumer goods value chain, by, for instance, establishing an internal marketplace for street furniture.However, several parties in the chain have conflicting interests. New financial models also require a change in the behaviour of consumers, not to mention suppliers. Furthermore, the municipality needs to communicate and create awareness for consumers to change their behavior, also by investing on the role of Primary education, incorporating schools into its network approach.<strong>Instruments</strong><strong>Procurement:</strong>Procurement is the instrument par excellence that connects the municipality with physical products. It enables the municipality to create a market for circular products. In recent years, there have been a number of procurement processes in which circular principles have been applied, with circular procurement of office furniture as the best known example.A further deployment of the procurement instrument can make a major contribution to the transition to a circular economy. This requires, among other things, a coordinating role of the lead buyers in the purchasing process, a different organisation of budgets and more functional questions.<strong>Research, information provision, and networks &amp; information exchange:</strong>With its knowledge tools, the municipality has both developed knowledge as well as shared it between market parties. These instruments have helped to acquire knowledge on all value chains.The instruments have been used successfully to increase the level of knowledge in the city, both within the municipality and with market parties and consumers. Especially the Living Lab approach and the public-private-people partnerships stand out as successful. Therefore, the continued deployment of these instruments is important for all value chains.<strong>Tools for upscaling</strong>The three promising value chains and the two mentioned instruments, together, form five action perspectives. These action perspectives are based on what is needed to scale up to the next phase of the transition.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxNDYxIDEwNjkiIHdpZHRoPSIxNDYxIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEwNjkiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYzQwLm9yZyUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZzdGF0aWMlMkZvdGhlcl91cGxvYWRzJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGMTk5M19JbnN0cnVtZW50c19fX1ZhbHVlX0NoYWlucy5vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmclM0YxNTQyMjc3MDAxIiBkYXRhLXc9IjE0NjEiIGRhdGEtaD0iMTA2OSIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+"/><strong>A. Upscaling the Construction value chain:</strong>In Amsterdam, the challenges in the construction sector are great: they are not restricted to new construction, they also include renovation/transformation, public space, and infrastructure. Should these projects not be built in a circular way, renovation or disassembly becomes difficult, or even impossible. It hinders the future high-value reuse of building products.The municipality of Amsterdam can accelerate the transition by a further deployment of the instruments of land issue, spatial planning, and legislation & regulations. In order to realise circular projects in the short term and to guarantee circular performance in the long term, a good cooperation with market parties is essential.<strong>B. Upscaling the Biomass &amp; Food value chain:</strong>This chain has seen many activities in recent years, thanks to the A further deployment of the instruments of spatial planning and business support by the municipality offers the greatest contribution. After all, in this chain it is the private sector that has to take the largest steps, and these need support. Continuing the commitment to the Biomass & Food chain ensures scaling up of innovations for high-value reuse. In this action perspective, for example, attention will be paid to activities that specifically focus on food and physical space in the city for decentralised solutions.<strong>C. Upscaling the Consumer goods value chain:</strong>As in any urban area, many consumer goods are being consumed in Amsterdam. With the continued growth of the city, the demand only increases further. Even more than transport and living, these consumer goods constitute the greatest environmental burden of households.Continued focus on this value chain will mainly be in the fields of business support and information provision. The current emphasis on the end of the chain (waste phase) can be transformed into a structural approach for the entire chain. This leads to a lower environmental pressure.<strong>D. Expanding the Procurement instrument:</strong>Both at the European and the national level, procurement is seen as an important government tool to drive the circular economy. An integral circular demand from the Municipality of Amsterdam drives suppliers to involve the complete chain.The procurement instrument can be applied to all value chains. The greatest potential for municipalities, however, lies in the value chains of Construction (in the physical city) and Consumer goods (for own management). Structural circular procurement of Amsterdam creates an incentive for suppliers to produce circularly, and also offers them a secure market.<strong>E. Expanding Research, Information provision, </strong>The transition to a circular economy shows, in many areas, a need for more knowledge and for sharing experiences. This does not only hold for technological knowledge, but also for knowledge on economic and financial incentives.By means of research, it should be feasible to chart technical and economic opportunities. Education & information provision should enable the municipality to involve new stakeholders and organisations in the transition. Furthermore, the municipality should also share knowledge and experiences in its networks, enabling all those involved to engage.<strong>The importance of working together</strong>Stating that the transition to a circular economy is realistic and profitable, there is still a demand for many changes in as many areas. The importance of intensive cooperation should not be underestimated. This concerns both internal cooperation within the municipality (both within and between departments) and cooperation with external parties, including between the triple helix of government, business, and science. For this cooperation to be successful, an open attitude, transparency and a willingness to share knowledge and experiences are essential. Learning from each other not only entails sharing successful projects, but failures as well<strong>Links to further Information</strong>Please find a comprehensive list of ‘Sources of Information’

Singapore: Bio-Engineering Works at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park to Prevent Urban Flooding
#################################################################################

            September 2018        In Singapore, rainfall statistics since 1980 have shown an increasing trend in the frequency of heavy rainfall events. When designing the expansion of the Kallang River to cater for higher-intensity storms, PUB – Singapore’s National Water Agency – did not adopt the conventional approach of creating a bigger concrete drain. Instead, it worked with NParks to explore how the river could be blended with the picturesque park while carrying a higher flow of stormwater. This could also create more value for the park users.   The Kallang River runs through Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park. Previously a concrete canal, it was transformed into a naturalized river with bioengineered river edges that meanders through the park so people can get closer to the water. PUB and NParks, the National Parks Board, worked together with consultants Ramboll Dreiseitl Studios and CH2M Hill Singapore on this innovative drainage improvement project to increase the capacity of the waterway yet providing a useable green space for the public to enjoy.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA5MzEgNTAyIiB3aWR0aD0iOTMxIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjUwMiIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYxOTYwX0JlZm9yZV9BZnRlci5vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmclM0YxNTM4MTMzNzM5IiBkYXRhLXc9IjkzMSIgZGF0YS1oPSI1MDIiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="><strong>Before (left) and after (right).</strong> Credits: Ramboll Studio Dreiseitl </img><strong>What does the project consist of?</strong>The redevelopment of the park was under the Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) Programme, which is a long-term strategic initiative to enhance the waterbodies and bring Singaporeans closer to water so that they can appreciate and cherish this precious resource.The overarching goal of the 76.7 million SGD ($56.3 million USD) project, part of ABC Waters Programme and carried out at Kallang River at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, was to enhance the drainage infrastructure within the built environment whilst bringing people closer to water. The project’s main focus was to increase the capacity of the river channel through bio-engineering to prevent the nearby roads from flooding during heavy rainstorms, and to provide a more natural and beautiful area for wildlife and citizens.PUB launched the ABC Waters Programme in 2006. By integrating the drains, canals, and reservoirs with the surrounding environment in a holistic way, the ABC Waters Programme aims to create beautiful and clean streams, rivers and lakes with enhanced public spaces for the community to enjoy. PUB worked closely with government agencies and consultants to develop watershed masterplans. PUB also solicited public feedback in workshops and outreach campaigns, involving the community, including through an ABC Waters Exhibition in 2007.Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park is one of the biggest and most popular parks in Singapore and has not had a major upgrading since it was built in 1988. At the same time, PUB also has plans to upgrade the Kallang River. Given this, NParks and PUB reviewed their individual development plans and the project became a joint collaboration between both agencies.Political leaders were supportive of the ABC Waters Programme from the onset. One such advocate was Dr. Yaacob Ibrahim, the Minister for Environment and Water Resources. The Programme also received support from the late Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, who was then Minister Mentor. Mr. Lee was impressed with the Programme and said that what is even more important is that everyone must help to keep our waters clean to make ABC Waters a success. <img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA4NDIgNjQ5IiB3aWR0aD0iODQyIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjY0OSIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYxOTYyX0Jpc2hhbjEuX0FtZXJpY2FuX1NvY2lldHlfb2ZfTGFuZHNjYXBlX0FyY2hpdGVjdHMub3JpZ2luYWwucG5nJTNGMTUzODEzMzc4MiIgZGF0YS13PSI4NDIiIGRhdGEtaD0iNjQ5IiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4="/><strong>What is the innovation?</strong><u>Extensive research and new technologies:</u><u>Public engagement and education: </u><img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxOTAwIDkyNyIgd2lkdGg9IjE5MDAiIGhlaWdodD0iOTI3IiBkYXRhLXU9Imh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGd3d3LmM0MC5vcmclMkZ3cC1jb250ZW50JTJGc3RhdGljJTJGb3RoZXJfdXBsb2FkcyUyRmltYWdlcyUyRjE5NjFfQmlzaGFuUGFya18xLm9yaWdpbmFsLmpwZyUzRjE1MzgxMzM3NjkiIGRhdGEtdz0iMTkwMCIgZGF0YS1oPSI5MjciIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/><strong>What were the barriers?

The land of the park is now being used in a much more effective way, and parts of the river have been widened to 5 times the original width. The park now also includes vegetated biotopes that cleanse the rainwater runoff before it enters the waterway. The transformed Kallang River at Bishan Ang Mo Kio Park is connected via the drainage network to Marina Reservoir in the city, allowing the water to drain away once the rain stops.The ABC Waters project at Kallang River at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park has won many local and international awards. Some of these accolades include the ‘Landscape of the Year’ Award at World Architecture Festival 2012, the 2012 Waterfront Center Awards’ Environmental Award and more recently, the Honour Award at the 2016 American Society of Landscape Architects Professional Awards.<strong>Co-benefits:</strong><u>Social:</u><u>Health:</u><u>Economic:</u><u>Environmental:</u><strong>Links to further information:</strong><a href="https://www.c40.org/wp-content/static/other_uploads/images/1963_AD-Ref_Singapore_Bishan-Park.original.pdf?1538133801" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bishan – Ang Mo Kio Park and Kallang River</a><a href="https://www.pub.gov.sg/abcwaters/explore/bishanangmokiopark" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ABC Waters homepage</a><a href="https://mothership.sg/2017/01/heres-why-you-shouldnt-be-alarmed-by-pictures-of-flooding-in-bishan-ang-mo-kio-park/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">'Here is why you shouldn't be alarmed by pictures of “flooding” in Bishan-Ang Mio Park'</a><strong>Contact Details:</strong>He Qihui<a href="mailto:HE_Qihui@pub.gov.sg">HE_Qihui@pub.gov.sg</a>

Proposal to Revitalise the Ciliwung River through Bamboo Forests
#################################################################################

            September 2018        More than 13 rivers are crossing the city of Jakarta with Ciliwung being the most important. At the same time, many people from rural areas come to Jakarta to improve their livelihood and most of them find living by the river. Unfortunately, the uncontrolled population growth in riverbank areas resulted in changes of the river itself – such as silting or increased water pollution. Therefore, the management of the riverbank is a necessary step to take if the flood issues that have been affecting local communities and economic opportunities are to be addressed.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA3ODAgMzkwIiB3aWR0aD0iNzgwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjM5MCIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYxOTQ4X0NpbGl3dW5nX1JpdmVyX0pha2FydGEub3JpZ2luYWwuanBnJTNGMTUzNzUzMzY2MCIgZGF0YS13PSI3ODAiIGRhdGEtaD0iMzkwIiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4=">Credits: The Jakarta Post</img>Today, Jakarta has only 10% of green areas compare to the 30% set by the approved regulation. That is why transforming the riverbanks into urban forests can help Jakarta meet its obligations and goals.Urban forestry has many functions. Amongst others, these include mitigating the risk of acid rain or absorbing carbon monoxide (CO) and dioxide (CO2) produced from city’s activities. Besides this, an urban forest is also a source of oxygen (O2), or again, it absorbs particles of lead (Pb) making the air cleaner.<strong>What is the innovation? How does it work?</strong>More trees along the river banks will provide many ecological benefits. Other than those cited above, an increased vegetation will maintain the microclimate in the surrounding areas, conserve water sources, and protect the water banks from erosion, preventing siltation. At the same time, community empowerment is promoted to preserve and maintain the urban forest and provide economic opportunities for the community.In fact, in addition to such ecological benefits, the urban/bamboo forest can be developed as an eco-tourism destination. Space can be arranged for pedestrians and cyclists. This will give a place for the community to rest and get together, as well as supporting the city transportation system. The green open space is a requisite for a healthy, liveable city, particularly thanks to its multipurpose and important function as a public area supporting urban and people lives.To achieve this, various bamboo plants and fast-growing orchard trees shall be planted. Bamboo groves are fast growing plants and they do not need special care. Bamboo plantations also do not require high investment. Once the bamboo clumps are well grown then it can be harvested each year without damaging the clumps. The root system is strong, resistant and spreads in all directions, holding the topsoil and preserving the riverbanks.This program also aims to provide opportunities for the community to develop the local economy and create jobs through the development of enterprises that use bamboo and/or promote ecotourism.There are 26 community organizations already involved with the ecological maintenance of the river and its surroundings, although the project is still in its early stages. For example, one of these organizations is providing environmental education by involving schoolchildren with the river and the riverbanks ecosystems. There are also several other community formations working on urban agriculture, waste-derived handicrafts, and on developing ecotourism.Some of the additional activities that could be undertaken at this early stage also include: Conduct research as a basis to support the adaptation programme as outlined above; Coordinate with stakeholders on preparing the programme; Strengthen and prepare institutions to manage the programme; Prepare proposals for funding and involving stakeholders participation.<strong>What are the CO2 reduction goals?</strong>Bamboo groves are able to absorb CO2 emissions 35% better than other plants, while producing 35% more oxygen. Bamboo can be used as a source of alternative renewable biomass or biofuel, replacing traditional fossil fuel sources.* Bamboo stems, leaves and shoots have a high cellulose content containing a lot of starch, sugar and active compounds. Through chemical and physical processes it can be transformed into biofuel and biomass energy. From the total bamboo taken, about 50 % – 57 % can be turned into biofuel and further into alcohol and diesel. In addition to that, bamboo-derived charcoal is useful as activated carbon for various purposes, including water purification and to bind toxins in the soil.<strong>Co-Benefits:</strong>Creating an urban forest of bamboo along the river Ciliwung in Jakarta will provide many ecological, economic, but also social and health benefits to the nearby communities.<u>Social and Health Benefits (projected):</u>Green open spaces shaded by bamboo could be used as social meeting areas for the community as well as playing ground for the children. This project will provide an opportunity to engage people on how to take care, maintain and respect the environment, especially the riverbanks and the river. Developing and maintaining bamboo forests also keeps the culture and the local wisdom of the bamboo utilization alive. Bamboo is widely utilized by the community, e.g. as building material for bridges, fences, furniture, musical instrument, crafts etc. Bamboo shoots are widely used as a food ingredient by many Indonesians.  It is believed that bamboo shoots are good for health since they contain high potassium and fiber that can reduce the risk of stroke, coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and colon cancer.<u>Economic Benefits (projected):</u>Investments in bamboo are safe and profitable. The demand for bamboo is always there and increasing. Planting bamboo in the city forest is very suitable because it can be developed into different innovative and excellent products. If the riverbanks could be developed as an ecotourism area, it will help improve the local economy by creating jobs. Another possible economic contribution is the decrease in government spending to stop erosion along the river banks, as well as reduce the cost of dredging. For the community, the root clump of bamboo will help retain water that can be readily used,  therefore helping to reduce public spending to channel water to nearby households.<strong>Next Steps:</strong>Development of bamboo forests in the riverbanks of Ciliwung is being considered in line with adaptation efforts in the city. It helps strengthen communities' resilience to climate change, and provides ecological, social and economic benefits. Jakarta is concerned and seriously handling the condition of rivers and of community activities along the riverbanks, because flooding can cause activity paralysis, economic and material losses. Thus, the government of Jakarta is also actively raising funds and advocating to get support from the private sector to build green open areas, including broader urban forestry strategies. To support communities’ economic activity, accessing funds from the various ministries such as Ministry of Small Medium Enterprises, are being looked into, in order to generate capital for community cooperation, product development, and marketing.From this possible pilot, the approach could be replicated and scaled-up in the other 12 rivers in the city.<strong>Contact Details:</strong>Dr. Aisa TobingGerakan Ciliwung Bersih<a href="mailto:aisa@jakarta.go.id">aisa@jakarta.go.id</a><a href="mailto:esa_tobing@yahoo.com">esa_tobing@yahoo.com</a>

            September 2018        In 2004, in Indonesia, energy demand from the building sector accounted for around 27% of the total energy consumption, and this figure is expected to increase to up to 40% by 2030, with the majority of new buildings expected to rise in Jakarta. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) noted that up to one-third of the energy and water consumed by buildings in Indonesia, including those in its capital city, can be reduced through better building design and management.<strong>What does the project consist of? </strong>Supported by the IFC, and assisted by the Clinton Climate Initiative and since 2009 by C40, Jakarta’s local government has identified low to middle-income high-rise housing in Daan Mogot as the pilot area for the Green Zone project.The built area will cover 17,6098 Ha and will consist of 7 sixteen-storey high-rise buildings, the Jakarta Grand Mosque – in process of completion – schools and hospitals.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMDg0IDUxNCIgd2lkdGg9IjEwODQiIGhlaWdodD0iNTE0IiBkYXRhLXU9Imh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGd3d3LmM0MC5vcmclMkZ3cC1jb250ZW50JTJGc3RhdGljJTJGb3RoZXJfdXBsb2FkcyUyRmltYWdlcyUyRjE5NDlfSmFrYXJ0YV9HQl9taXNzaW9uLm9yaWdpbmFsLnBuZyUzRjE1Mzc1MzY0OTIiIGRhdGEtdz0iMTA4NCIgZGF0YS1oPSI1MTQiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg==">Credits: <a href="https://greenbuilding.jakarta.go.id/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://greenbuilding.jakarta.go.id/ </a></img><strong>What is the innovation? </strong>To accelerate the implementation and development of the Green Zone project, the Governor established a Green Building Forum composed of a group of various stakeholders, aiming to mainstream the concept of Green Building as it has been defined by the The first stage has been to formulate the ‘Grand Design’ of the Jakarta Green Building Programme.

            September 2018        Switching to renewable energy sources follows Quezon City’s vision of becoming a low carbon and sustainable city aiming to promote sound environmental governance as well as explore and develop successful means to take advantage of climate change mitigation and adaptation opportunities. In fact, the City’s Environment Policy Management Council (i.e. the City’s highest executive body which determines City’s direction in environmental management and climate change), adopted and approved the EPMC 2015-02, otherwise known as the “Resolution Granting Approval of the Solar Energy Project in Quezon City Public Schools and Creation of the Technical Working Group for This Purpose”<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxMDAwIDc1MCIgd2lkdGg9IjEwMDAiIGhlaWdodD0iNzUwIiBkYXRhLXU9Imh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGd3d3LmM0MC5vcmclMkZ3cC1jb250ZW50JTJGc3RhdGljJTJGb3RoZXJfdXBsb2FkcyUyRmltYWdlcyUyRjE5NDVfUUMub3JpZ2luYWwuanBnJTNGMTUzNzIwNDM0MiIgZGF0YS13PSIxMDAwIiBkYXRhLWg9Ijc1MCIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+">Credits: Asian Dragon Magazine</img><strong>What does the project consist of? How does it work? </strong>The pilot project consists of installing 380 hybrid solar panels, 20 inverters and 160 batteries, on five buildings within the school compound of the Commonwealth High School. The school serves also as an evacuation area in times of disaster, and thanks to the installation of this hybrid system, it will have the capacity to produce power without being connected to the grid.A Hybrid Design has been adopted for the solar panel system. It features an Intelligent Power Prioritization whereby the load generated by the solar panels is automatically used to meet the energy demand. Surplus energy will then be stored in batteries, and once the latter are fully charged, it will be used to supply the national grid, generating rewards in the form of electric credits. This also lowers the electricity costs for the school as it will only need to purchase power from the grid when the local energy supply is insufficient to meet the power demands.The Solar Power Facility stretches over an area of 984m<strong>What are the CO2e reduction achievements? </strong>The Solar Power Facility is projected to contribute to a reduction of 88.07 tCO2e per year.<strong>Next Steps: </strong>The City has applied to the C40 Cities Finance Facility (CFF) for technical and financial assistance for the expansion of the project in fifty selected public schools throughout the City.<strong>Contact Details: </strong>Ms. Frederika RentoyHeadEnvironmental Protection and Waste Management DepartmentQuezon City GovernmentTel.

With practically no recyclable purposes, it has been disposed of indiscriminately in environmentally sensitive locations such as waterways and landfills among others. In Quezon City, the primary challenge faced was that plastic bags were improperly discarded. While representing a missed opportunity to recover, reuse and recycle plastic, they also negatively impacted the city’s waste stream, contributing to various nuisances to the environment.In a study conducted by the Environmental Protection and Waste Management Department, plastic bags have been found to amount to 12% of the total waste composition of the city. This finding motivated implementation of an effective system of plastic bag recovery which sought the participation and commitment of the business sector and the citizens to protect the living environment. In 2012, the City Government enacted the Quezon City Ordinance SP-2140 series of 2012, entitled “An Ordinance Regulating the Use of Plastic Bags and Establishing an Environmental Fee for its Use, Providing Mechanism for Its Recovery and Recycling and Providing Penalties for Violation Thereof” otherwise known as the The Quezon City Plastic Bag Reduction Ordinance has been then integrated into the harmonization of the city’s local environmental ordinances in 2014, leading to the creation of the Ordinance No. SP-2350, S-2014 or An Ordinance Providing for the Environmental Protection and Waste Management Code of Quezon City, also known as the “QC Environment Code”.<strong>What's innovative? How does it work?</strong>Type 1 retailers (Shopping Malls, Supermarkets, Department Stores, Grocery Stores, Fast Food Chains, Drug Stores, Pharmacy) shall impose a Plastic Recovery System Fee (PRSF) of two pesos (P2.00) for plastic bags having a thickness not lower than 15 microns. The establishment of a plastic recovery system fee was designed to primarily change consumer behavior rather than to generate funds. Such fees are put in place to change consumer habits and awareness, encouraging the use of reusable bags. This measure seeks to curb the amount of plastic bags in the waste stream, institutionalizing a more efficient and convenient recovery system for plastic bags in line with the 3Rs principle.A comprehensive, in-depth consultation with the business sector was undertaken to create the plastic bag recovery system and the plastic bag recovery fee. Since this wasn’t primarily a revenue generation scheme, the plastic recovery fee was not remitted to city’s funds. Instead, it remains with the retail stores and then utilized to fund various environmental initiatives, subject to prior approval of the city government. To monitor progresses, each retail business has to submit quarterly to the City Government a self-monitoring report detailing the quantity of recovered plastic bags and the amount of collected plastic recovery fee.As of the end of 2017, a total number of 6,269,278 pieces of plastic bags were recovered.A number of establishments have already implemented their “green fund” projects. For instance, one establishment utilized these revenues to donate 11,000 chairs made from converted soft plastic to various schools across the city. Another example is the donation of several eco-bicycles to the city’s police force.The compliance of the business establishments with the scheme and their initiative to develop and implement “green fund” projects added to the credibility and success of the city’s Plastic Recovery Fee System. In addition, this policy intervention addressed multiple concerns (e.g. the regulation of plastic bags), and is now contributing to shift consumers behaviour towards a more reuse-oriented attitude, as well as institutionalizing a revenue generating system that directly benefits the local communities and contributes to the city’s objective of becoming a low carbon and sustainable city.<strong>Links to further information:</strong><a href="https://www.c40.org/wp-content/static/other_uploads/images/1944_irr_sp2140.original.pdf?1537202613" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The QC Plastic Bag Reduction Ordinance</a><a href="http://quezoncity.gov.ph/index.php/featured-articles/875-qc-plastic-bag-reduction">http://quezoncity.gov.ph/index.php/featured-articles/875-qc-plastic-bag-reduction</a><strong>Contact Details:</strong>Ms. Frederika RentoyHeadEnvironmental Protection and Waste Management DepartmentQuezon City GovernmentTel.

#################################################################################

            September 2018        Quezon City has been renowned for its unparalleled success in solid waste management. By implementing an innovative program, the city is transforming an iconic wasteland into an internationally recognized waste-to-energy model, becoming the first city in the Philippines to recover methane gas from waste disposal.This innovative project would have not been possible without the strong political will of the city to radically transform the ‘Payatas’ open dumpsite into a controlled waste disposal facility, especially after a trash slide claimed 300 lives in the local community. Following this tragedy, the city initiated massive rehabilitation works, including slope reprofiling, stabilization and greening, leachate collection and recirculation, the improvement of the drainage system, and the fortification of access paths to the site.In 2002, the City Government started to collaborate with the Philippine National Oil Corporation (PNOC) to set-up a 100 kilowatt pilot methane power plant at the Payatas Controlled Disposal Facility (PCDF), which has been successfully launched in 2004 as part of the city’s conversion program to turn methane into electricity.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyOTcgMjQ4IiB3aWR0aD0iMjk3IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjI0OCIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYxOTQxX1BheWF0YXMxLm9yaWdpbmFsLnBuZyUzRjE1MzcxOTg3MjEiIGRhdGEtdz0iMjk3IiBkYXRhLWg9IjI0OCIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+">Credits: quezoncity.gov.ph</img>Three years later, in 2007, the Quezon City Government initiated a scale-up of the scope and capacity of the project by establishing a public-private partnership on solid waste management. More specifically, the City forged an agreement with a private energy company – Pangea Green Energy Philippines, Inc. – regarding the capture, collection, processing, and flaring of landfill gas (LFG), including the conversion of methane into electricity. Consequently, the project has been also registered as a Clean Development Mechanism under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyOTcgMzM2IiB3aWR0aD0iMjk3IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjMzNiIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYxOTQyX1BheWF0YXMyLm9yaWdpbmFsLnBuZyUzRjE1MzcxOTg3MzQiIGRhdGEtdz0iMjk3IiBkYXRhLWg9IjMzNiIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+"/><strong>What does the project consist of?

            September 2018        In Vietnam, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been increasing owing to the rapid economic growth. In response, in 2008, the Prime Minister at that time decided to implement the National Target Program to Respond to Climate Change (NTP-RCC), containing a comprehensive direction for climate change measures in Vietnam. All concerned agencies were mandated to formulate climate change measures up to the target year 2020.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxNjAwIDkwMCIgd2lkdGg9IjE2MDAiIGhlaWdodD0iOTAwIiBkYXRhLXU9Imh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGd3d3LmM0MC5vcmclMkZ3cC1jb250ZW50JTJGc3RhdGljJTJGb3RoZXJfdXBsb2FkcyUyRmltYWdlcyUyRjE5MzZfaG8tY2hpLW1pbmgtY2l0eS1jZW50cmUuanBnLm9yaWdpbmFsLnBuZyUzRjE1MzY5Mjg0MTkiIGRhdGEtdz0iMTYwMCIgZGF0YS1oPSI5MDAiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/>Credits: Vietnam-guide.comIn 2011, the prime minister adopted the National Strategy on Climate Change, and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MoNRE) was tasked to formulate the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) in collaboration with the relevant ministries. In relation to this, local governments are supposed to develop and implement low-carbon action plans. The local governments are required to understand their GHG emissions, monitor the implementation status and the effect of NAMAs objectively, and promote measures continuously. Policies and plans have been prepared in some local governments; however, the quantification of GHG emissions, expected emission reductions, and actual emission reductions remains a challenge.Alongside strengthening the capacity to develop climate change measures, the capacity to objectively evaluate the effects of such measures and modify or add new measures accordingly needs further enhancement. In this context, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) started a technical cooperation project aiming to enhance the capacity of the Vietnamese Government to plan, implement and manage NAMAs, taking MoNRE as the counterpart organisation.<strong>Scope of the Project:</strong>1) To collect data required to quantify HCMC’s GHG emissions in energy, transport, industry, agriculture, land use and waste sectors;2) To provide technical capacity building for improving calculation and monitoring methods and the calculation approach for each sector;3) To conduct baseline survey of HCMC’s NAMAs (especially focusing on the energy sector) and carry out technical assistance so that cities will be able to assess the progress of NAMAs in the future;4) To understand GHG emissions in HCMC, consolidate and organise the information and knowledge obtained through the project, hence establish, propose and support dissemination of a MRV style across the country.<strong>Results:</strong>The activities can be largely grouped into GHG inventory, MRV on climate change mitigation measures, and training and seminars. The activities in HCMC started in October 2015 and ended in October 2017. On GHG inventory, from October 2015 the initiatives undertaken to date were studied, and the data sources and preparation principles were studied and considered. Subsequently, the preparation of the GHG inventory commenced, and by August 2017 it was largely completed. The drafting of the GHG Inventory Preparation Manual commenced in November 2016 and was completed in October 2017. To achieve this, teams from JICA and C40 cooperated on developing the inventory using the GPC framework and putting data into the City Inventory Reporting and Information System (CIRIS).On MRV, gathering and analysis of basic information and mitigation measures started in October 2015. The MRV piloting started in August 2016 and the drafting of the MRV Manual started in September 2016 and was completed in October 2017, incorporating the results of the pilot MRV system. On training and seminars, there were 2 trainings on Climate Change Mitigation, 2 internal training workshops for MoNRE’s officials on GHG Inventory in HCMC, and 2 on GHG Inventory and MRV in Japan. <strong>How does it work?</strong>At the national level, the Project has provided essential technical and advisory inputs to MoNRE’s preparation for the Government Decree on Roadmap and Modality for Reducing GHG Emissions. It includes, inter alia, technical analysis of framework and national MRV. The Decree is anticipated to serve as the first national, Paris-compliant, legal framework guiding implementation of mitigation measures, and ensuring the effectiveness of Vietnam’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). In parallel, in September 2016 the Project launched the ‘Low Carbon Technology Assessment’, providing means of implementing NDCs from a low carbon technology angle. It offers direct technical inputs to enhance on-going processes to review and update Vietnam’s NDC.At the municipal level, the Project has selected Ho Chi Minh City as a model city, hoping to establish the technical expertise needed to continuously quantify GHG emissions and emissions reduction. Based on the Global Protocol for Community-scale GHG Emission Inventories (GPC), the Project delivered key outcomes regarding 2015 HCMC GHG inventory. Key deliverable is also the MRV manual guiding quantification of emission reductions for Energy, Transport and Waste projects, which currently awaits institutionalization by the city.<strong>What are the CO2 Reduction Goals?</strong>Based on the <strong>GHG Inventory:</strong>Of the 91 cities participating in C40, 60 cities have prepared a GHG inventory based on the GPC standard. Most cities only report the emissions in the three main sectors: Stationary Energy, Transportation and Waste. HCMC is among the only five cities with an inventory covering all five sectors: Those mentioned above plus Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) and Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU).<strong>Next Steps:</strong>Following the good momentum nurtured thus far, and further supported by a Memorandum of Cooperation between JICA and C40 in support of climate action planning in HCMC, the Project is now entering into its final year of cooperation (ending in January 2019). Technical support activities in HCMC will be focusing on:1) Conducting studies for necessary revision and enhancement of the current policy framework;2) Elaborating city-level monitoring and evaluation to support quantification of policy impacts;3) Supporting action plan development and MRV for the targeted pilot sector – i.e. transport. It was also highlighted that those activities in HCMC should directly support the implementation of the Government Decree, which is currently under formulation at the national level.<strong>Links to further information:</strong><a href="https://www.jica.go.jp/project/english/vietnam/036/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.jica.go.jp/project/english/vietnam/036/index.html </a><a href="https://www.jica.go.jp/project/english/vietnam/036/c8h0vm00009um1se-att/project_summary_sheet_en.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.jica.go.jp/project/english/vietnam/036/c8h0vm00009um1se-att/project_summary_sheet_en.pdf </a>Ha Minh ChauManager in Charge, Climate Change BureauHo Chi Minh City Department of Natural Resources and Environment63 Ly Tu Trong, Ben Nghe Ward, District 1, HCMC, Vietnam<a href="mailto:hminhchau.stnmt@tphcm.gov.vn/">hminhchau.stnmt@tphcm.gov.vn</a><a href="mailto:chauctr@yahoo.com.vn">chauctr@yahoo.com.vn </a>Koji FukudaChief Technical Advisor / JICA ExpertA211, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE)No.10, Ton That Thuyet St. Hanoi, Vietnam<a href="mailto:fukuda.koji@friends.jica.go.jp">fukuda.koji@friends.jica.go.jp</a><a href="mailto:fukuda.monre.vientam@gmail.com">fukuda.monre.vientam@gmail.com </a>

Mitigate Urban Flooding in Ho Chi Minh City - Phase 1
#################################################################################

            September 2018        Located on the delta areas of Sai Gon River and Dong Nai River systems, Ho Chi Minh City is facing many challenges relating to urban flooding caused by high tides and heavy rainfalls. Climate change and its consequences, such as increasing intensity of heavy rains and sea level rise, exacerbate these challenges and cause negative impacts on the city’s socio-economic development. For example, between 1962 and 2001, there have been 9 incidents of “extremely heavy” rain (i.e. 3-hour accumulated rainfall exceeding 100 millimeters) exceeding the capacity of the drainage system. This means only one “extremely heavy” rainfall every 4 years for the past forty years. However, from 2002 to 2017 there have been 44 “extremely heavy” rains recorded in the area of Ho Chi Minh City, that is 3 times per year. Flooding is even more problematic when heavy rain happens during high tidal times, resulting in water levels in rivers and canals being higher than sewer discharge valves, thus preventing discharge through the normal sewage system.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA4NTAgMjgwIiB3aWR0aD0iODUwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjI4MCIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYxOTM0X0Zsb29kZWQtdXJiYW4tYXJlYXMtaW4tSENNQy5vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmclM0YxNTM2OTI1MjAyIiBkYXRhLXc9Ijg1MCIgZGF0YS1oPSIyODAiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/>Credits: Vietnam News and Thanh Nien News<strong>What does the project consist of?</strong>To mitigate urban flooding in Vietnam’s most populous city, in October 2008 the Master Plan for Flooding Prevention was approved by then the Prime Minister, and consisted of dividing the city into 3 water control areas while implementing flood prevention plans for each of these areas. Phase 1 of this flooding mitigation project started in June 2016 and is expected to be finished by the end of 2019, covering an area of 570 km2, home to 6.5 million people (Area IA1 in Picture 1). These new flood control systems are designed to control water levels in Ho Chi Minh’s canals and enhance the effectiveness of its drainage system.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA2OTMgNjU2IiB3aWR0aD0iNjkzIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjY1NiIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYxOTM1X0hDTUNfbWl0aWdhdGVfZmxvb2RpbmdfcHJvamVjdC5vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmclM0YxNTM2OTI1MjM2IiBkYXRhLXc9IjY5MyIgZGF0YS1oPSI2NTYiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/><strong>Picture 1: Area of the Project (Area IA1)</strong><strong>The components of Phase 1 include:</strong>The operation procedures of flooding protection works are summarized as follows:During rainy season:During dry season:*A sluice is a water channel controlled at its head by a sliding gate or other devices for controlling the flow of water.<strong>Next Steps:</strong>When Phase 1 is finished and all facilities are fully operating, the municipality will carry on developing urban flood control measures for Area IB and IA2 (Picture 1) and also Area II (newly-developing areas in the right bank of Sai Gon River).<strong>Links to further Information:</strong><a href="https://www.trungnamgroup.com.vn/du-an/tat-ca.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.trungnamgroup.com.vn/du-an/du-an-</a><a href="http://www.ttcn.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/chuong-trinh-du-an-chong-ngap/-/ext/articleview/article/447746/10182" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://www.ttcn.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/chuong-trinh-du-an-chong-ngap/-/ext/articleview/article/447746/10182</a><strong>Point of contact: </strong>Dr.Phan Anh Tuan, Head of R&D Division The Steering Center of the Urban Flood Control Program Ho Chi Minh CityEmail: Fax: (+84.8)3526 5354Mr. Ha Minh Chau, In-charge Manager of Climate Change Bureau Ho Chi Minh City Department of Natural Resources and EnvironmentEmail: Phone: +84 916556578

The Patuli Floating Market: A Case Study of Relocation and Rehabilitation Project in Kolkata, West Bengal
#################################################################################

            September 2018        In 2012, the Government of West Bengal entrusted the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) to take up the project of widening the Eastern Metropolitan bypass road in Kolkata in order to ensure capacity enhancement of one of its main vehicular traffic corridors. However, during the widening process, 228 shopkeepers were uprooted and relocated about 3 KM from where they historically used to be established.Due to this long distance and the lack of local transport, residents living nearby the Eastern Metropolitan bypass were finding it difficult to get daily consumption items, while in turn, storekeepers saw their daily income affected because of the resulting drop in demand. Furthermore, due to the high-speed movement of vehicles following this road widening, there was the additional risk of fatal road accidents when approaching this new relocated market.After 2 years, it was observed that this relocation project was not successful, causing challenges to both consumers and shopkeepers. On one hand, vendors were asking to be relocated closer to the residential areas so that they could sustain their livelihoods through regular income, while on the other hand, local residents were complaining because of the inconvenience in getting day-to-day items like vegetables and groceries.There was a 600 Mtr. long and 50 Mtr. wide water body adjacent to these residential areas – the Lake Patuli – which was fighting for its ecological survival due to a continuous flow of solid and liquid waste into it. Local residents found it convenient to dispose of their kitchen and other solid waste in the lake, and sewage discharged from the housing around its shores also ended up in the lake.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA4NTAgNDc3IiB3aWR0aD0iODUwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjQ3NyIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYxOTMzX1BhdHVsaS5vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmclM0YxNTM2OTI0Mjc5IiBkYXRhLXc9Ijg1MCIgZGF0YS1oPSI0NzciIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/>Credits: The Telegraph India (left); Scroll.it (right)<strong>What does this project consist of?</strong>To overcome all these problems, Shri Firhad Hakim, Chairman of the KMDA & Minister of the Urban Development and Municipal Affairs Department, came up with a very innovative solution. A restoration project was undertaken under his able guidance by the KMDA, aiming to take up remedial measures for the lake revival, such as diverting the drainage of sewage waste while continuously monitoring water health parameters like BOD, Dissolved Oxygen, TDS etc.In addition, the project consisted of connecting 114 boats across the Lake, making it home of a new floating market. All these boats were fitted with LED lighting, while other necessary arrangements like drinking water, toilets, and fire safety were made to take care of consumers and sellers needs. To maintain an optimal water level, submersible pumps and lock gate mechanisms were implanted. Furthermore, various species of fish were released to restore the lake’s ecological balance, while floating aerators were provided to maintain a healthy biological oxygen balance. Moreover, solar panels were installed on each boat’s roof, producing up to 90% of the total market electricity demand.<strong>Contact Details: </strong>Please contact

And this, in turn, sets a sequence in motion – no salvage value and expensive proposition to collect, sort and store. Hence such plastic waste ends up to landfill or is littered in the streets, water bodies or burnt with leaves and other waste materials.<strong>Findings:</strong>Carried out by more than a hundred volunteers across 8 locations around the city, the Bengaluru Waste and Brand Audit revealed that amongst the 12,000 pieces of plastic sorted, 607 different brands have been identified, respectively 479 representing local firms and 128 international brands. The International top polluters recognised were multinational corporations like Coca-Cola, Nestlé, Pepsico, Cadbury and Domino’s, or again Johnson & Johnson, Colgate-Palmolive and Amazon. Almost 90% of this ‘branded litter’ falls into the food packaging category with the remainder being personal care and household packaging. Of the 10,300 pieces of plastic regarded as food packaging, the 61% is completely not recyclable with just the 8% of the total amount being highly recyclable.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA1NDUgMzc4IiB3aWR0aD0iNTQ1IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjM3OCIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYxOTMwX0JFTkdBTFVSVV9XYXN0ZUF1ZGl0MS5vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmclM0YxNTM2OTE3MDMyIiBkYXRhLXc9IjU0NSIgZGF0YS1oPSIzNzgiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/><strong>The Solution:</strong>The Indian’s Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016 and Policy Resolution for Petrochemicals 2007 encourage the producers to implement waste collection system and phase out single-use plastic while conferring them the primary responsibility of this collection.

Energy Retrofits Protecting the Cultural Heritage in Heidelberg
#################################################################################

            August 2018        The old city-center of Heidelberg together with the famous castle of Heidelberg forms a stunning example of medieval and baroque architecture and is the most-visited historical site in the Baden-Württemberg state. The municipal administration is putting great effort into conserving historical city streets and buildings for tourists and visitors, but also into preserving the identity of Heidelberg itself.Naturally, all buildings consume energy, in Heidelberg primarily for heating. This is why, aside from protecting the cultural heritage, the municipal administration aims to significantly reduce the energy consumption of all public buildings, including those in the historical city centre.The Palais Graimberg is located right below the castle of Heidelberg and hosts the offices of the First Deputy Mayor and the Mayor for Environment, Citizen Services and Integration, as well as the City Planning office.As a result of the energy retrofit, the energy consumption for space heating has been reduced by 50%, from approx. 200 kWh/mTherefore, the architects, together with the municipal Department for Energy, developed a set of bespoke measures, including: insulation of the top-floor ceiling and the roof without removing the historic brick cover; new tailor-made windows fitted perfectly to the historic appearance, keeping the heat inside of the building.Instead of adding an external wall insulation, an internal insulation formed of a 5cm-thick layer of cellular concrete was installed, which resulted in halving the heat transfer coefficient for 80% of all walls. This had the highest impact on reducing the heat demand. The replacement of all piping for heat distribution and the renewal of all electrical installations completed the retrofit with additional energy demand reduction.Three years after the energy retrofit was completed, the measured energy demand for heating of the Palais Graimberg is well below 90 kWh/m<a href="https://www.c40.org/wp-content/static/other_uploads/images/1904_Picture_1.original.JPG?1534343589"><img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyMDAwIDE1MDAiIHdpZHRoPSIyMDAwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjE1MDAiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYzQwLm9yZyUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZzdGF0aWMlMkZvdGhlcl91cGxvYWRzJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGMTkwNF9QaWN0dXJlXzEub3JpZ2luYWwuSlBHJTNGMTUzNDM0MzU4OSIgZGF0YS13PSIyMDAwIiBkYXRhLWg9IjE1MDAiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/></a>In 1896, the Heidelberger Gymnastics Club (still existent) employed the architect Wilhelm Mai to construct a new training center for its members. More than 100 years later, this sports hall, the Klingenteichhalle, is still used by many athletes. In 2013, the city administration decided to refurbish the sports hall, as some installations (heating, showers, lighting, etc.) were not safe to use any more and the heating demand had increased significantly.The architects were facing the same challenges as with retrofitting the Palais Graimberg. An external insulation would destroy the 100-year-old brick-facade, not to mention the beautiful church-like windows. The heat transfer coefficient of these old single-glass windows was 5.0 W/ mThe calculations made by the architects assumed that with these measures in place, the heating energy demand would drop to 110 kWh/m<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyMDAwIDE1MDAiIHdpZHRoPSIyMDAwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjE1MDAiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYzQwLm9yZyUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZzdGF0aWMlMkZvdGhlcl91cGxvYWRzJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGMTkwNV9QaWN0dXJlXzIub3JpZ2luYWwuSlBHJTNGMTUzNDM0MzgzMSIgZGF0YS13PSIyMDAwIiBkYXRhLWg9IjE1MDAiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/>

The Sustainable Street Markets & Parks project: From organic waste to a high-quality compost resource
#################################################################################

            August 2018        The pilot project is located in the Lapa district, one of the city’s 96 districts, stretching over an area of 3,000 m2. Officially opened in 2015, the project has been overseen by technical experts to monitor its economic and environmental benefits. The types of waste accepted at the composting park include fruits, vegetables, green garden waste and structuring materials such as wood chips. The maximum treatment capacity of the composting park is 54 tons/week and a total output of high-quality compost of 10.8 tons/week. <strong>CO2 reduction</strong>The composting park will achieve a reduction of 87% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from organic waste treated, compared to the business as usual scenario which currently consists of disposing of this type of waste in a landfill. This should bring the GHG emissions from 819,1 kg CO2e/t to 110,3 kg CO2e/t, and amounts to about 160 tons of CO2e avoided per month. These figures do not even reflect the benefits of indirect emissions reductions from compost use in agriculture that are estimated at -130.5 kg CO2e/t and that would lead to an estimated net saving of 20.2kg CO2e/t.<strong>Next Steps</strong>The city plans to launch another 10 similar decentralized composting parks by 2020 in different regions across São Paulo.

Retrofitting and adapting the slussen lock
#################################################################################

            May 2018        The New Slussen project and reconstruction is vital for the entire Stockholm region around Lake Mälaren. The New Slussen will both protect key infrastructure from flooding, and secure the drinking water basin for two million people.The project will redesign and retrofit the existing 80-year-old structure. Intended to last for another 100 years, the new facility incorporates elements of climate resilience and flexibility by design. The foundations of the New Slussen facility will be oversized for current conditions in order to bear the heavier loads from rising sea levels and the higher flood gates that are projected to become necessary from 2050 onwards.Forming the central junction between north and south Stockholm, Slussen is a strategic infrastructure asset with regard to transport, clean water provision and flood protection for Stockholm and the Mälardalen region. Slussen’s lock allows boats to transit between Lake Mälaren and the bay leading to the Baltic Sea (Saltsjön). The lock also acts as one of the gates between freshwater (Mälaren) and saltwater areas (Baltic Sea), thereby playing a key role in the provision of clean water. Mälaren is the main drinking water source in the region, supplying over 2 million people. When the lake’s waters rise, due to spring snow melting, for example, the lock’s gates can also be opened to discharge excess water and prevent flooding.Mälaren is the third largest lake in Sweden, with about 5% of Sweden’s area within the watershed. The lake stretches 120 kilometres from east to west and holds around 14.3 billion cubic metres of water.The city of Stockholm has authorisation to regulate the water level of Lake Mälaren through the opening and closing of six locks in Stockholm and the City of Södertälje.The project aims to achieve three main objectives and functions at the site.<strong>Transportation: </strong><strong>Quality of life</strong>But the main objective is Flood and Water Management: By building larger channels, the New Slussen project should allow the lock to release nearly five times more water from Lake Mälaren into the Baltic Sea, up to 1,400 m³/s. Coupled with a new water regulation plan for the lake and a responsive system of hydrological monitoring and forecasting, the increase in drainage capacity reduces the risk of flooding in Stockholm and its region.The main climate-related risk taken into consideration for the design of New Slussen is flooding from Lake Mälaren, given the rise in sea level and the lake’s low drainage capacity. Several vulnerability studies have quantitatively assessed current and future flood risk around the lake.The towns surrounding Lake Mälaren are highly vulnerable to flooding, according to analysis by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI). Currently, the mean water level difference between the lake and the sea is less than 70 cm.The Stockholm area is subjected to two opposing forces: rising water levels in the Baltic Sea related to climate change, and a geological process known as ‘land uplift’ causing its land to rise.The New Slussen lock has been designed for what has been deemed an acceptable level of risk. The level of risk New Slussen can withstand from the Lake Mälaren and the Baltic Sea bay is:• a 1-in-10,000 year inflow of freshwater into the lake (from extreme rainfall and rapid snow melt, for instance) combined with a rise in the mean water level of the Baltic Sea by the year 2100;• a 1-in-300 year event of maximum high tide position in the Baltic Sea in combination with the highest, but not the most probable, projected sea level rise due to climate change over the next 100 years (0.5m), and a local rise in sea level due to strong wind.This means that the New Slussen facility can cope with a sea level that is over two metres higher than today’s average water level in the Baltic Sea bay (Saltsjön). The project includes three main measures which will make the asset, the City of Stockholm and the Mälardalen region, more resilient to climate change:• Addressing the current and future flood risk due to climate change around the Lake Mälaren by increasing the lock’s drainage capacity from 300 m3/s to 1,400 m3/s by widening and deepening its existing channels. Overall, New Slussen more than doubles the total discharge capacity of Lake Mälaren.• Building in climate adaption and flexibility in the project’s design to accommodate higher flood risk levels, by ‘oversizing’ the foundations for the whole facility and to support the heavier water loads from the sea and the higher flood gates that will become necessary from 2050 onwards.• Developing a new water regulation plan to account for climate change impacts. In addition, this plan integrates a new system of hydrological monitoring and forecasting, led by SMHI, to allow the regulation of water levels in the lake to be more responsive.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA2NDcgMjcyIiB3aWR0aD0iNjQ3IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjI3MiIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYxNzczX18ub3JpZ2luYWwucG5nJTNGMTUyNzE4MjUwOCIgZGF0YS13PSI2NDciIGRhdGEtaD0iMjcyIiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4="/>If the sea level of the Baltic Sea outside Stockholm continues to rise above half a metre, there will be a need for more actions to be taken on a larger regional scale. One such action could be to install barriers outside the city of Stockholm in the Stockholm archipelago.This would address future unacceptable flooding risks and could be a possible future complement to increased discharge capacity.

Quadplex guaranteed energy savings project
#################################################################################

            May 2018        Philadelphia’s first Guaranteed Energy Savings Project is saving $1.4 million in annual energy costs, and resulted in buildings that are easier to operate, more comfortable for tenants, and have fewer capital needs.The City selected NORESCO through a competitive request for proposal process to determine the feasibility of energy conservation measures (ECMs) in the City’s ‘Quadplex’ buildings: City Hall, Municipal Services Building, One Parkway, and the Criminal Justice Center. The City selected high payback energy conservation measures that produced a project with positive cash flow, strong environmental benefits, and improvements to tenant spaces. The completed project includes nine standard ECMs throughout the four buildings. This work resulted in facilities that are easier to operate, more comfortable for tenants, and have fewer immediate capital needs in addition to energy savings. Together, the Quadplex represents 12% of the City’s General Fund energy usage, and the project now saves the City $1.4 million annually in energy costs.ECMs include: lighting improvements, lighting control systems, water conservation, steam system insulation, building control system updates, high efficiency air filters, vestibule improvements and building envelope improvements and weatherisation.The project is now in its measurement and verification phase, and work is under way to ensure building operations continue to support expected project savings.Under Pennsylvania’s Guaranteed Energy Savings Act (GESA), all municipalities are enabled to enter into contracts with energy service companies (ESCOs) to develop energy efficiency projects. This is the type of contract vehicle used to implement this project. The legislation also authorises third party financing so that annual utility and operational savings can support the project repayment over a 15-year contract term, meaning an up-front budget allocation is not necessary.7,800 MTCO2ePhiladelphia is now launching another GESA project at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the largest energy user in the municipal portfolio. The City is also exploring using GESA to retrofit streetlights to LED, and for additional energy projects at the Prisons Complex and other sites.

            May 2018        In Moscow, across all sectors of the economy, there is a significant amount of work taking place to drive down greenhouse gas emissions. The city of Moscow has been calculating the volume of greenhouse gas emissions since 2007. The base year selected to make further estimations of greenhouse gas emissions was 1990 (under the Presidential Decree of the Russian Federation № 752, 30.09.2013 “On greenhouse gas emissions”).According to the results of the inventory held in 2016, greenhouse gas emissions data in the city of Moscow was as follows: Area 1 ‒ 59,059,034 tons СО2 equivalent. Area 2 ‒ 3,609,079 tons СО2 equivalent. Area 3 ‒ 20,293,820 tons СО2 equivalent.Calculations show that Moscow has currently already achieved a reduction of over 20% of greenhouse gas emissions when compared with the base of 1990.Moreover, the city of Moscow regularly evaluates how different sectors of the economy may impact on climate change adaptation. The city’s own plans, and measures to combat greenhouse gas emission, are revised and adjusted on the basis of the results obtained by the evaluation process.Since 2013 Moscow has implemented the biggest landscaping programme in the city, called “Million Trees”. The aim of the programme is the growth of green spaces in the city and the creation of a pleasant urban environment. The environmental effects of the programme include an increase in the proportion of green spaces, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions through increasing their natural absorption, and adaptation to climate change by regulating the microclimate in courtyard spaces.The uniqueness of the programme lies in involving citizens in the process of developing urban spaces. People can choose a particular place and a particular type of a plant. Moreover, the plant species that citizens can choose from have scientific backing and are adapted to the Moscow climate and the urban environment.The decision-making process takes place via a special internet platform called “Active Citizen”. The voting process has two stages. In the first stage, citizens vote on whether to landscape their courtyard, after which specialists assess the possibility of planting new trees and bushes.In the second stage, citizens choose specific tree and shrub species to plant. Citizens can choose from those plant species which are resistant to the impact of the urban environment. A special booklet containing greenery recommended for planting in courtyard areas was created as part of the project. The booklet is available on the official website of the Moscow Department of Natural Resource Management and Environmental Protection (in the section “Ecology” → “Green spaces of Moscow”).Planting is carried out through the spring and autumn seasons (the list of locations where planting is planned is posted on the official website of the Moscow Department of Natural Resource Management and Environmental Protection (in the section “Services and feedback” → “Million Trees” project).As part of the planting events, a large number of environmental education events are also held, such as master classes for students, and environmental holidays, aimed at educating children and teenagers about the environment, including them in caring for green spaces.Since the beginning of the “Million Trees” project in Moscow:– 15,300 courtyard territories have been greened;– over 90,400 trees and 1.8 million bushes have been planted;– over 1.5 million citizens have taken part in the voting process;– over 11,000trees and 300,000bushes were planted in 2017.The average volume of СО2 equivalent emissions sequestration by one tree is about 20 kg. The total volume of СО2 equivalent emissions sequestration over the period from 2013 to 2017 is almost 2 million tons СО2 equivalent.As part of continuing “Million Trees”, the Moscow Department of Natural Resource Management and Environmental Protection has already received a number of requests from Moscow social organisations for 2018. It is planned to green 281 areas connected with a social use, planting 1,500 trees and 50,000 bushes there during the spring season. There will be a voting procedure among citizens in which they will able to choose which tree and shrub species will be planted in the city’s courtyards.Links for further information:https://www.mos.ru/city/projects/mln-derevyev/http://www.dpioos.ru/eco/ru/million_derevievhttp://www.dpioos.ru/eco/ru/green_planting/o_14377

Nanjing Jiangnan Environmental Protection Industrial Park
#################################################################################

            May 2018        Nanjing Jiangnan Environmental Protection Industrial Park is a park hosting environmental protection businesses receiving majority support from the municipality of Nanjing, which has the important task of organizing centralised disposal of domestic garbage and solid waste across the city.The businesses planned for Nanjing Jiangnan Environmental Protection Industrial Park include: power generation from the incineration of domestic garbage; disposal of solid biohazardous waste; renewables recycling; research and development of environmental protection science and technology as well as environmental services. Its development goal is to build a ‘venous industry’ (turning solid industrial waste into reusable resource) and an urban mine demonstration zone at national level, a national circular economy zone, and a science dissemination and education base for Nanjing.Firstly, a domestic garbage incineration power plant was built. Since the start of its operation in 2015, by September 2017 it had disposed of 2.85 million tons of domestic garbage and more than 600,000 tons of landfill leachate, generating 1.05 billion kWh of power and achieving sales income of approximately 630 million yuan. It has made an important contribution to the disposal of biohazardous waste, and to the reduction and recycling of domestic garbage in Nanjing.Secondly, a landfill site was built as a supporting project to the garbage incineration power generation project. This is mainly used to deal with incinerator ash generated from the garbage incineration power plant. The designed capacity of the landfill is 220 ton/day (120 tons of slag and 100 tons of ash per day).Thirdly, a comprehensive slurry disposal centre was built. This solves the issue of construction slurry disposal in Nanjing and contributes to the reduction, bio-safety, stabilisation and resource utilisation of slurry.The programme will be accelerated with waste disposal at its heart. Key projects comprise: firstly, integrating the comprehensive disposal of solid waste and the emergency disposal of urban garbage, which, upon completion, will add capacity of 80,000 ton/year for hazardous waste disposal, and capacity of 1,500 ton/day for domestic garbage disposal. Secondly, the comprehensive disposal of hazardous solid waste, with incineration capacity of 30,000 ton/year, physicochemical treatment capacity of 30,000 ton/year, and safe fill capacity of 20,000 ton/year. Thirdly, battery recycling and regeneration, which will build a power battery cascade and lead-acid battery recycling and regeneration base.

Nanjing 'Green Credit’ system
#################################################################################

            May 2018        Since March 2016, Nanjing has made available a low-carbon travel public service platform. It offers green credit and green store functions in the My Nanjing app, organised subject activities of low-carbon travel, and implemented green credit reward through integrating green travel data on walking, cycling, metro and bus usage. So far, the daily visits to the Nanjing low-carbon travel public service platform have reached about 0.8-1 million, with more than 20,000 active daily users and more than 1.8 million participants in total.Taking the carbon footprint concept as its basis, the product programme makes the connection between individuals’ low-carbon behaviours and carbon management; a concrete method of credit quantification is determined as well. Citizens’ real-time low-carbon behaviours are recorded and quantified into carbon reductions using green credits granted via the My Nanjing app. Citizens may use the green credits to trade discount and public services and other commodities in the green store.Step by step, Nanjing will build a city-wide carbon-inclusive system promotion platform based on the low-carbon travel public service platform and the carbon footprint concept. It will organise the implementation of a carbon-inclusive system pilot programme, further quantify carbon reductions deriving from the low-carbon behaviours of the public, reward members of the public with corresponding credits or carbon coins, and encourage the public to embrace a low-carbon life. We will establish a commercial incentive mechanism to develop financial and fiscal policies that support the promotion of the carbon-inclusive system. We will also encourage financial organisations and business alliances to develop innovative carbon-inclusive financial products such as carbon credits and carbon coins to facilitate the public in enjoying low-carbon rights and interest and credit exchange. We will support financial organisations to build green loans, green securities, green insurance and green trust and thereby to expand the financing channels of low-carbon enterprises.

Raising awareness of sustainability in an urban society
#################################################################################

            May 2018        Climate protection and sustainability are central to the urban development of Heidelberg. All the city’s municipal buildings have been constructed or retrofitted to the highest efficiency standards. Over the last seven years apartments for nearly 4,000 people were constructed in a net-zero district. The district heating system used by the local utilities is one of the greenest in Germany. And trams, charging stations for electric vehicles and cycling paths are continuously improved. However, if you want to turn this positive spirit from the last few decades into a something enduring you need to have the broad support of the citizens. Therefore, for many years the municipal administration of Heidelberg has carried out a number of projects to raise awareness of sustainability, starting with the youngest citizens – in childcare centres.<strong>Sustainability as part of teaching in municipal childcare centres</strong>Following a decision of the local council in 2012, sustainable development education has been a mandatory element of daily life at municipal childcare centres (around 50% of all childcare centres in Heidelberg). A good example of this is that 30% of the nutrition provided has to be produced in an ecological and socially fair way. By exploring this aspect of food, children begin to understand the importance of responsible interaction between nature, animals, humans and resources. The same is true for many other activities, like playing in the garden, looking for insects and birds and learning why it is important to switch lights off. Additionally, the city is encouraging and training non-municipal childcare centre operators (such as churches and private organisations) to implement these aspects into their own teaching.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxIDEiIHdpZHRoPSIxIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYzQwLm9yZyUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZzdGF0aWMlMkZvdGhlcl91cGxvYWRzJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGMTc3MV9leHBsb3JpbmdfbmF0dXJlX2J5X0Z1JTI1Q0MlMjU4OGxvcF8ub3JpZ2luYWwuanBnJTNGMTUyNzE2NzQ4NyIgZGF0YS13PSIxIiBkYXRhLWg9IjEiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/><strong>Sustainability as a part of pupils’ daily life</strong>On leaving kindergarten, children enter elementary school. Via a booklet, the administration informs parents about this new and exciting area of pupils’ education. Sustainability and climate protection form a key part of this booklet, and parents are encouraged to let their children walk to school. This is possible as, following the principle of “Short legs – short ways”, there are schools in Heidelberg in walking distance of every residential area. If parents are worried about the safety of their children, they can use or start up a “walking school bus”. Children walk to school in a group following a defined route. At fixed “bus stops”, the groups pick up other children to join the group. On their route, one “bus driver” accompanies the kids, in most cases a mother or a father of one of the children. This system exists at many schools in Heidelberg.Walking to school leads to better health through activity, increases safety as fewer cars drive and park around the schools, reduces fuel consumption, improves air quality and, finally yet importantly, educates children about their mobility behaviour.Additionally, schools can join the E-Team project. The municipal administration supports schools financially, which commit to a sustainable education by implementing mobility concepts, organising energy-efficiency projects or participating in waste prevention events. Schools receive additional grants when they manage to reduce their energy consumption through responsible heating, turning the lights off and other non-investment-related measures.Educating pupils also means educating their parents. Children talk to their parents about things they learned at school. This can often lead to new thinking about sustainability in their social surroundings.The municipal administration not only directly obliges teachers and educators to teach sustainability, it also offers continuing education in close cooperation with the University of Heidelberg, the Heidelberg Center for the Environment and particularly with the Heidelberg University for Education.<strong>Never stop learning</strong>Young adults can make their voices heard on sustainability at the biannual youth climate summit. There, they have the chance to discuss their ideas for a sustainable development with political and business leaders (such as the mayor and the chief executive of the local utilities). Similar to the E-Team projects at schools, the City of Heidelberg supports sports clubs when they invest in energy-efficient products or organise events dedicated to sustainability. Clubs work perfectly as accelerators, as they play a major role in German communities. Such cooperation has, for example, led to the replacement of conventional halogen lamps with LEDs at a soccer field and an indoor tennis centre. The effect has been a 50% reduction in electricity demand. It may also have prompted club members to consider replacing their lamps at home.<strong>The political background</strong>To implement such a variety of projects in this depth, the administration needs the strong support of the local parliament. By signing the Charter of Through all these measures, climate protection, clean air, preservation of species and other aspects of sustainability are established in urban society. And, by starting with the youngest, the city builds a path into a sustainable future. <img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyMDAwIDEzMzMiIHdpZHRoPSIyMDAwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEzMzMiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYzQwLm9yZyUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZzdGF0aWMlMkZvdGhlcl91cGxvYWRzJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGMTc3MF9yZXBhaXJfeW91cl9iaWN5Y2xlX2J5X0Rvcm5fMjAxNl8ub3JpZ2luYWwuanBnJTNGMTUyNzE2NzI1MCIgZGF0YS13PSIyMDAwIiBkYXRhLWg9IjEzMzMiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/>

Guangzhou’s waste management system
#################################################################################

            March 2018        Recent years have seen Guangzhou improving its urban waste management system and developing waste treatment facilities. In 2016, daily household waste was about 25,000 tons, among which 18,800 tons were treated by landfill or incineration. Landfill accounts for 84% while the rest 16% of waste was burned. 6,700 tons of renewable waste was recovered, and the renewable recovery network covers 100% of the rural and urban areas. 100% of hazardous industrial waste was treated and utilised. The disposal rate of medical waste was 100%, the integrated utilisation rate of industrial solid waste reached 95%, and 90% of construction waste from demolition was recycled. Guangzhou has explored a way for a megacity to sort and treat solid waste.Firstly, the city is further pushing ahead on household waste sorting. In 2014, the city was listed among the country’s best cities in household waste sorting. Secondly, the city is continuing its efforts in advancing the sorting management system. Thirdly, the city makes an effective connection between waste sorting and waste recovery. Fourthly, the city is pushing forward the development of waste treatment facilities in a holistic way. As of now, Guangzhou has built three thermal power plants for household waste, which disposes of 5,000 tons of waste per day. Five thermal power plants, with a total disposal amount of 12,000 tons per day, are now under construction and expected to be completed and put into use by the end of 2018.Firstly, Guangzhou will further carry forward precise household waste sorting. In government institutions and public places, a compulsory precise waste sorting system will be in place to avoid mixed waste collection and transport. Secondly, the city will further strengthen recovery of renewable resource, actively pushing forward the integration of the waste collection and transport system and the resource recovery system. Thirdly, the city will make greater efforts in reducing waste production by reducing excessive packaging of commercial products. Fourthly, Guangzhou will improve its capacity in dealing with construction waste, greening waste and sludge, medical waste, industrial waste and hazardous waste. Fifthly, the city will make good use of high-standard and clean technology to build waste treatment facilities to solve the urban waste problem.After all the thermal power plants are built by 2018, it will be possible to treat 17,000 tons of household waste per day. This will lead to a total of 6.2 million tons of waste being disposed of every year, with a reduction of CO2 emission of around 13.26 million tons. If this amount of waste goes to landfill, around 6.04 million tons of CO2 and 420,000 tons of methane will be produced, which equals 14.866 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

New waste collection system in Venice
#################################################################################

            March 2018        The City of Venice area is characterised by two distinct territories: the mainland with the populous urban area of Mestre and its suburbs, and the lagoon with Venice, its historic centre and several islands.Waste collection has always been very difficult in the lagoon area, because of the unusual way in which the city was built with its canals and narrow pedestrian alleys. The problem has also become nearly untenable due to the presence of 30 million tourists a year, several colonies of seagulls which worsen the spread of garbage, and rat proliferation.At the end of 2016, the City of Venice’s in-house company, Veritas, began a new way of collecting waste: both door to door (from 8:30am to noon) and by allowing people to deliver the waste themselves to boats fitted with trash compactors available from 6.00-8.30am. Self-delivery is a good solution for students and workers who leave early in the morning. This new system has now been implemented in about 99% of the historical centre.Tourists or citizens who stay at home longer can wait for the garbage man to ring their bell. Prior to 2016, garbage was simply deposited outside on the street near front doors, causing unpleasant smells, litter and low quality separation of waste collection.The boats are fitted with special compactors for plastic, glass, cans, paper and general waste. On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays they collect paper; on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays they collect glass, plastic and cans. General waste is collected every day. An important aspect of this new system is that boats are supervised by employees of Veritas and therefore separated collection for recycling is improving.Collection and sorting of bulky waste is free for citizens by scheduling an appointment. Eight used oil collection bins are also available in the city.Veritas operatives also a manual sweeping service which takes place early each morning throughout the city.Separated collection is now increasing so that a smaller amount of garbage is now sent to the waste incineration plant. CO2 emissions should therefore decrease. Unfortunately, we do not yet have updated data available on this decrease.

Shenzhen carbon emission trading system
#################################################################################

            March 2018        Shenzhen City, Beijing Municipality, Tianjin Municipality, Shanghai Municipality, Chongqing Municipality, Hubei Province, and Guangdong Province were selected as first pilot provinces and municipalities for carrying out carbon emissions trading. This was in accordance with overall rules for responding to climate change set out by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council of China. This was in order to: implement the requirements of the 12th Five-year Plan for gradually establishing the carbon emission trading market in China; promote the use of the market mechanism to achieve China’s objective of controlling greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 and doing so at an affordable cost; and accelerate economic development and industrial structure upgrading.By the end of 2016, 635 out of the 636 enterprises included in the carbon trading control system in Shenzhen had completed the 2015 carbon trading compliance work on time and in full. In terms of the reduction of structural emissions achieved under the Shenzhen carbon emission trading system has achieved notable results since going into operation in 2013. The carbon emissions of 636 enterprises included in the system of control fell by 5.81 million tons in 2015, down by 18.2% since 2010. Shenzhen has also made adjustments and improvements to its carbon trading allowance allocation system: in 2016 it adjusted the allowance allocation method for participating enterprises to the advanced carbon intensity allocation method, and used this method to calculate the 2016 target carbon intensity for participating enterprises. Shenzhen has also continually increased efforts to promote the regional carbon market, strived to build the first cross-regional carbon trading market in China, and established the first carbon market capacity-building base in China – the Shenzhen Center for National Carbon Market Capacity-building.Before the launch of its carbon emissions trading market, Shenzhen calculated the urban carbon emission list, which set the total carbon emission for the enterprises included in the control system and allocated an allowance for the three years of the pilot period. During the carbon emissions trading pilot period, participating enterprises must first quantify and report their own annual carbon dioxide emissions, and then have independent third-party verification institutions verify their emission reports. They must also guarantee that their carbon intensity does not exceed the carbon intensity target set by the government. Participating enterprises whose carbon emission is lower than their allowance may carry over surplus allowance to the following year for use or sell it directly on the carbon market for profit.In order to establish a system complete with both legal provisions and government regulations, Shenzhen has developed and passed Provisions of Shenzhen Special Economic Zone on Carbon Emission Management, Interim Measures of Shenzhen City for the Administration of Carbon Emissions Trading, and other relevant documents. And the units included for control are accurately monitored and strictly verified: any relevant noncompliance and counterfeiting, etc, which is discovered will lead to comprehensive verification, and, once the noncompliance is confirmed, corresponding punishment, including fines, and even blacklisting, will be conducted. Once blacklisted, enterprises will be subject to “one-vote veto” in terms of finance and taxation, etc. In this way, this strict control mechanism forces units included for control to actively practise energy conservation and emission reduction.The Shenzhen carbon emissions trading system covers 40% of carbon emissions in Shenzhen, with the main objective being to restrict the total emission of those enterprises included in the control system, and reducing the carbon intensity of enterprises included in emission control by 25% by 2015 from a 2010 base. Statistics show that by 2015 the absolute carbon emission of units included for control had declined by 5.31 million tons since 2010, with the carbon intensity down by as much as 41.8%, far exceeding the 21% reduction target issued by China to Shenzhen during the 12th Five-year Plan period.In the 13th Five-year Plan of Shenzhen City for Responding to Climate Change, Shenzhen clearly set out its ambition to: strengthen carbon emission management of enterprises included in government carbon emission control; implement a third-party verification and reporting system and an allowance compliance system of carbon emission; promote the energy conservation and emission reduction of enterprises; promote the construction of an energy management system and energy management centre for key energy-using enterprises; focus on advancing the top 10,000 enterprises’ energy-saving and low-carbon activity; strengthen demand-side management, and boost end energy-using products to improve energy efficiency.In addition, according to 2016 Work Summary and 2017 Work Plan of the Development and Reform Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, Shenzhen will further improve the carbon emission trading system in the following ways. Firstly, continue to expand coverage of the city’s carbon trading in the transportation field; actively explore including taxi and public building enterprises in the carbon emission trading system; actively introduce new trading categories and energetically develop carbon finance by giving full play to the advantages that Shenzhen boasts of high market activity and a developed information and financial industry. Secondly, cooperate on completing arrangements for building a national market and ensure the smooth transition from the Shenzhen carbon market to the national carbon market, according to the work goal of the National Development and Reform Commission, which aims to launch national carbon emissions trading in 2017. Thirdly, further progress the training for national carbon market capacity-building with the Shenzhen Center for National Carbon Market Capacity-building as the platform, and take the above opportunity to attract other cities in China which have a good base in this field which value low-carbon development, especially cities which have a similar industrial make-up, in order to carry out in-depth regional carbon market cooperation with Shenzhen. Fourthly, strengthen carbon trading publicity, and carry out relevant training on carbon trading; continue to increase carbon trading publicity and training efforts for the new enterprises included for control, and gradually increase the public’s awareness and acceptance of carbon trading; conduct extensive publicity through media, social and government platforms, etc; actively respond to the demands of enterprises included for control, and complete the compliance work for 2016.Development and Reform Commission of Shenzhen Municipality

Shanghai international tourism and resorts zone central gas distributed energy station
#################################################################################

            March 2018        This project is one of the typical cases of “combining Disney global standards with local best practice”, jointly created through close cooperation between the Chinese and American sides. As the sole “international tourism and resorts zone” project with power supplied by a third party, the Shanghai international tourism and resorts zone central gas distributed energy station is listed as a Sino-US energy cooperation demonstration project. All of this project’s finished design products have been reviewed by the specialised technical team at Disney. The design level has been fully recognised by the American side and presents a good start for Sino-US energy cooperation in the future, having very good demonstration value for reference. Howard Brown, the senior vice president of Shanghai Disney Resort and the project development executive, said, “the use of distributed energy station in the resort will significantly save development and operation cost of the resort and expect to increase the overall energy efficiency by 3 times, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions generated by the operation of the resort by 60%.” This project is located within plot H-11 to the west of the resort. It plans to build 10×4.4MW gas engine generating units. During this period, the construction scale is 5×4.4MW gas engine generating units, reserving conditions for extension of 5×4.4MW gas engine generating units. The occupied area within the project boundary is about 19,748m2, totalling 239.76m from east to west and 82m from south to north. The energy station is mainly divided into two areas: the production area (accounting for 15,000m2) and an area for future extension (accounting for 4,748m2).The total investment in this project is about 431.75 million yuan, with annual production of 112 million kWh; annual cooling capacity of 399,000GJ, in which 253,000GJ comes from waste heat; annual heating capacity of 153,000GJ, in which 98,900GJ comes from waste heat; annual compressed air supply of 41.38 million Nm3, with an annual heat-to-electric ratio of 108% and an energy saving ratio of 29.9%.Process equipmentThe main equipment of this project uses five sets of GE’s JMS624GS-N.L gas engine generating units, with 4035kW generated output, generating efficiency as high as 45.4%. The waste heat recovery equipment adopts five sets of flue gas hot-water Lithium-bromide units and the refrigeration and heating quantity of single unit are 3490kW and 3478kW, respectively. Meanwhile, four centrifugal water chilling units, and three sets of gas-fired hot water boilers are adopted. In addition, chilled water storage and water thermal storage systems are used for peak load regulation.This project follows the principle of: ordering power by heat; maximising the use of cooling and heating with waste heat; producing cool/warm water with gas engine exhaust and high temperature jacket water into flue gas hot-water lithium bromide units; and combining with the electric centrifugal chilled water units, chilled water storage for outward cooling supply or combined with gas boiler, hot water storage tank for outward heating supply, with a comprehensive energy utilisation efficiency of 83%. Under the prerequisite of ensuring stable and reliable heating and cooling supply, the power needed for peak load regulation inside the energy station is supplied by the energy station itself; at the same time, under the condition of guaranteeing economic efficiency and practicality of the system, the method of extra electricity 35 kV on grid is adopted.Innovative designThis project provides cooling, heating, electricity, warm water and compressed air to the central area of Shanghai international tourism and resort zone (Disneyland) through natural gas, clean, single consumption energy, realising co-generation of five energies with a one-time comprehensive energy utilisation rate of up to 83.41%, which is far higher than 70% (the one-time energy utilisation rate of conventional distributed energy supply system), and has already reached the advanced level in the world. Through highly efficient gradient utilization of natural gas, it not only meets all the energy demands within the 3.9 square kilometres of the central area, but also builds the tourism and resort zone into a low-carbon, energy-saving, green and ecological tourism and resort zone (the energy saved is equivalent to 21,883.08t of standard coal, with an annual reduction in CO2 emissions of 75,541.87t, equivalent to 40,000t fewer trees felled). At the same time, it provides guidance for a full upgrading of large-scale tourism and resort areas in Shanghai, China and even all over the world. This project uses an advanced gas engine generating unit with generation efficiency as high as 45.45%. The lithium-bromide units are flue gas hot water operated and improve the thermal efficiency of the whole system by making full use of the heat from the gas engine tail flue gas and the gas engine jacket water. This project uses chilled (hot) water storage system, uses the difference of peak energy consumption to adjust the operating mode in an appropriate way, maximises the unit utilisation rate and enables a significant increase in its economic efficiency. The cold and warm medium water quality for this project adopts the strictest requirements in the world, 2-3 times higher than counterpart American standards. Its copper corrosion speed is required to be less than 0.0025mm/a, and steel corrosion less than 0.025mm/a, which is far more strict than the requirement of copper and iron corrosion speed specified in the Code for Design of Industrial Recirculating Cooling Water Treatment (0.005mm/a for copper and 0.075mm/a for iron). By adopting advanced chemical water treatment technology, this project meets the requirement of cold/warm medium water in the resort zone.The cold and warm medium water is designed with different colours, to facilitate the operation and management of the system. In order to guarantee that the whole enclosed system of cold and warm medium water quality meets the requirements, we carried out sealing and airtight measures on all the water storage tanks in the system, and injected nitrogen in the air chamber above the liquid surface for protection to completely separate the water in the system from the atmosphere. At the same time, overflow pipes with water seals and suction mufflers are installed on the water tanks to prevent damage to the tank. The secondary pump of this project adopts high power variable frequency pump and automatic control technology. When the system causes the pressure difference at the most unfavourable point of building user deviating from design value as a result of load change, it will automatically interpret and analyse the  deviation value to obtain the order to increase or reduce water, and it will send the order to the energy station. And the frequency control of the energy station’s secondary pump will enable the inlet and outlet water pressure difference to return to the design value, thereby always ensuring maximum energy-saving can be achieved by just meeting the water quantity requirements of all the users.  The cold and hot medium water system is a gas-free enclosed circulating water system with constant pressure featuring non-compressibility, large flow and high velocity. A check valve bypass is set up between the water inlet and outlet header of the secondary pump. When water flows through the check valve bypass, in case of a sudden outage, the kinetic energy is consumed by overcoming resistance into thermal energy, thereby avoiding damage as a result of direct impact on equipment by water hammer caused by the potential energy of the water flow. The safety valve needs to be set up to discharge extra swelling water that may cause system overpressure in case of temperature rise in the cold and hot medium water system. In order to meet the requirement of the round-the-clock, non-stop operation of the system, when installing the safety valve as per standard requirements, the replaceable safety valves with isolation valves are parallelled to enhance the safety and reliability of the system. This project adopts a noise treatment plan and noise countermeasures, for instance: a multi-layer composite acoustic insulation module is used on the roof and walls in the main plant area; sound-proof fire doors are used for the main plant area; windows on the external wall of the main plant area are soundproof; mufflers are installed on the vent of the external walls and roof of the main plant area; sealing and soundproof treatment is carried out on the wall pipe in the external walls of the main plant; a large air inlet silencer is installed at the air inlet of the cooling tower; sound barriers are installed to the east, north and south sides of the main plant roof; silencers are set up for the exhaust fans on the main plant roof. Within an extremely constrained area, noise and firefighting requirements in relevant codes are met. The noise treatment meets the emission limit of Class 2 functional zone as specified in Emission Standard for Industrial Enterprises Noise at Boundary. Noise in the daytime is controlled to be below 60dB and 50dB at night 1m outside the boundary. The boiler is equipped with an economiser, which improves the efficiency by to 95%, with low nitrogen combustion technology adopted. The gas engine has considered reserving the location for denitration equipment to meet environmental protection requirements.The energy station uses clean natural gas as fuel and can realise power supply, cooling, heating, hot water for life and compressed air at the same time, which almost covers all kinds of energy demand in Shanghai international tourism and resort zone, truly worthy of the name of a low-carbon, energy-saving, green and ecological resort.

The implementation of the Superblocks programme in Barcelona: Filling our streets with life
#################################################################################

            March 2018        Today's streets need to be redefined as public spaces; as habitable places; as community spaces; as an extension of housing; as a space for games, greenery, history and the local life of neighbourhoods. Rethinking the city through new ways of grouping, based on traditional blocks, allows us to reconsider the role played by streets and, also, to foster social interaction.The Superblocks programme is a new way of organising the city, redistributing public areas between vehicles and people through the specialisation of streets. This new city mobility structure limits the number of streets for through traffic and frees up the remaining streets for other functions, such as recreation and relaxation. The results of this hierarchical change are new urban units – larger than a block, but smaller than a neighbourhood, which are known as Superblocks or Superilles.The prevailing criteria used here underscore what is already in existence: public spaces as a common asset; protecting neighbourhoods from through traffic; reducing pollution and accidents; strengthening pedestrian rights and social cohesion. On the other hand, re-naturalising new public spaces with planted elements (tactical urbanism) and soft (permeable) surfaces is another important factor for the urban design of these new spaces. This enables us to deal with the problem of increased and excessive impermeability in urban areas.Barcelona is a dense and compact city, with all the benefits this entails with regard to travel needs and efficiency in the use of natural resources. Despite all the efforts made over the last few decades, Barcelona remains a city with few green spaces. By adopting the Barcelona Climate Commitment, the city aims to increase its urban green areas by 1.6 km2, i.e. by 1 m2 per current city resident. In order to achieve this ambitious goal, various strategic projects and measures are being implemented, including the Barcelona Resiliency and Climate Change Adaptation Strategy and the Barcelona Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plan. The Superblocks project reverses the current priorities for streets, creating more opportunities for providing space for citizens and mitigating the lack of green areas. This project is expected to extend citizen spaces/car-free spaces by over 23 hectares.<strong>What is the innovation/policy/project/technology? How does it work? </strong>The project does not involve major physical changes, but rather tactical urbanism: promoting soft measures that are often low-cost and easy to adapt. It represents a new way of understanding and providing benefit to the city, allowing experimentation.Superblocks fosters urban transformation based on maximum participation and civic co-responsibility in all phases of the project. Barcelona City Council offers the maximum level of public dialogue and consensus building on diagnosis and proposals, as well as on the implementation of the programme.<strong>What are the CO2-reduction goals/achievements? </strong>Barcelona City Council’s starting point, and ongoing reference points, are the climate change commitments that it has already adopted. But the council and its citizens wish to go further at a city level, through the network of signatories to the Citizen Commitment to Sustainability 2012-22, and with all Barcelona stakeholders keen to participate in reducing gas emissions and adapting to climate change in the coming years.  Through collective action, the city aims to ensure that by 2030 Barcelona will have reduced its per capita levels of CO2-equivalent emissions by 40% compared to 2005 levels (3.14 GEH/inhabitant).To achieve these goals Barcelona City Council is introducing a variety of programmes and projects. Here the Urban Mobility Plan, linked to the Superblocks programme, is crucial as it will enable a 21% reduction in private car and moped use in the city. To this end, the plan involves a range of strategies, including completing 233km of bike lanes by the end of 2018 and implementing a new ‘orthogonal’ bus network for the whole city. Other key actions are included in the Barcelona Energy, Climate Change and Air Quality Plan 2011-2022.<strong>Next Steps</strong>The Urban Mobility Plan establishes that the entire city is to be organised into Superblocks, so the programme includes mobility network planning, so that any project carried out in the city is developed under this new structure. In this way, the programme establishes sufficiently flexible functional criteria that can be adapted to the characteristics of each city district, while also ensuring the uses and functions foreseen for all types of the streets. In the neighbourhoods of Sants, Les Corts and Poblenou the programme has already been implemented, while it is in train in Horta and Sant Antoni. More neighbourhoods are currently being considered for the programme.<strong>Links to further Information</strong><strong>Key impact </strong>Any other statistics or details you would like to highlight for viewers, especially in regard to the impact it has or will have on citizens of your city The impact the Superblocks programme has on citizens of the city are numerous: empowering people, particularly children and the elderly, given the fear that traffic generates; fostering intergenerational relationships through public areas where people can meet and carry out leisure activities; strengthening people’s emotional bonds with their environment while participating in decision making; increasing public safety by increasing vitality in the streets; making more space available for physical exercise; and so on.<strong>Annual CO2 reduction</strong>The Urban Mobility Plan (UMP), linked to the Superblocks programme, is crucial and will enable a 21% reduction in private car and moped use in the city. The predicted reduction of CO2 in the scenario of 21% reduction of UMP traffic was 22.6% of t since 2011 (reference data) 2018. In absolute values it is supposed to go from 785 t to 608 t (reduction of 177 t).<strong>Contact Details </strong>Neda KostandinovicAvda. Diagonal, 240, 4th floor

The Madrid Recupera Plan
#################################################################################

            March 2018        After a period of urban extension based on the creation of new peripheral neighbourhoods, Madrid urban planning is now turning towards a city regeneration strategy focused on the areas most vulnerable to climate change.In order to develop this new regeneration strategy in the residential buildings sector, Madrid City Council is carrying out an urban plan named Mad-Re, which aims to improve building conditions in those areas of the city with the lowest social, economic and construction standards.The plan began in 2016 with the goal of promoting building interventions that would improve energetic performance, reduce energy consumption and emissions, enhance accessibility, solve problems posed by existing architectural features, as well as foster restoration works, and preserve and improve the state of the buildings.The Mad-Re action plan provides grants to subsidise works in dwellings. The interventions financed are:The neighbourhoods covered by the plan are located in the inner city as well as the outskirts. Locations were selected on the basis of their social, economic and environmental vulnerability. A set of indicators was used to select the target areas, and this included: building age (before 1980), building value (0.8 under the average), educational attainment (1.20 above the average), or population age (1.20 above the average).From a climate change point of view, the plan contributes to mitigation and adaptation. The isolation and energy efficiency improvements reduce consumption, local pollutants and CO2 emissions. As a result, dwellings are better prepared for extreme thermal conditions, and energy poverty vulnerability is therefore reduced.Regarding adaptation to climate change, the plan also focuses on the most vulnerable areas. It has to be pointed out that the selected neighbourhoods were evaluated according to heat waves and extreme temperature exposure. Those areas were compared with maps of hot spots and UHI (Urban Heat Island) as well as with studies of climate change vulnerability assessments. It concluded that almost all of them are located in the most vulnerable parts of the city.In order to qualify for grants, proposed works have to be evaluated and must raise the energy efficiency category of the building by one or two levels. The bigger the improvement, the higher the subsidy.The Mad-Re plan began in 2016 and comprised 112 areas, over 3,546 hectares, and was open to 1,198,326 inhabitants (38% of the whole population). In 2017 the number of areas was increased to 120, including more than 590,000 homes and 43% of Madrid’s population.The results of the two campaigns for the years 2016 and 2017 are:<strong>Mad-Re 2016</strong><strong>Mad-Re 2017</strong>The Mad-Re plan will continue over the next few years and will be complemented by other initiatives with similar objectives for public spaces or institutional buildings.<strong>Links to further information</strong><a href="http://www.madrid.es/portales/munimadrid/es/Inicio/Vivienda-y-urbanismo/Plan-MAD-RE?vgnextfmt=default&amp;vgnextoid=e000cb5ee0993510VgnVCM1000001d4a900aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=593e31d3b28fe410VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD">http://www.madrid.es/portales/munimadrid/es/Inicio/Vivienda-y-urbanismo/Plan-MAD-RE?vgnextfmt=default&amp;vgnextoid=e000cb5ee0993510VgnVCM1000001d4a900aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=593e31d3b28fe410VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD</a><strong>Contact details</strong>Ayuntamiento de Madrid

Electric buses: purchase of bus stock (130 low-floor, low-emission buses) with associated infrastructure
#################################################################################

            March 2018        The Warsaw electric buses project includes: replacement of 10% of the vehicle stock of Warsaw MZA municipal bus operator with 18m articulated electric buses; and creating associated infrastructure, including the construction of aerial chargers at the ends of selected bus lines, and the adaptation of bus depots. In the long run the project will assist the Poland-wide trend towards electric mobility, limiting risks related to CO2 emissions generated by fossil fuels consumed in the transportation sector worldwide. The project will also massively reduce the amount of pollutants such as NOx and SO2, which are generated by diesel buses. It will also lead to a massive reduction in noise produced by standard vehicles.It should be noted that emissions from transportation are the commonest reason behind air pollution breaches in Warsaw. For example, in 2011 concentration of transportation-generated PM10 amounted to 62.4 µg/m3, while its total maximum concentration was 84.7 µg/m3. In this year concentration of transport-generated NO2 amounted to 41.3 µg/m3, while its total maximum concentration was 47.5 µg/m3. There was a similar situation with CO2, whose emissions from transport increased from 1,339,282t in 2007 to 1,791,757t in 2012 – so by as much as 33.78%. On the other hand, CO2 emissions and pollutants from buildings and energy production have been decreasing. All this leads to the conclusion that transforming transportation in Warsaw towards e-mobility is the key to addressing the environmental and climate challenges that the city is facing.The project is supported by co-financing from the Polish Operational Programme “Infrastructure and Environment”, which distributes EU assistance funds. The application was submitted in December 2016 and the resulting funding agreement was signed in October 2017. In accordance with the agreement, the total cost of the project will amount to 89.5 million USD, including external financing of 47.5 million USD. The remaining 42 million USD will be covered by the applicant – MZA bus operator, which is a municipal company 100% controlled by the City of Warsaw.<strong>What is the innovation/policy/project/technology? How does it work?</strong>It is also the largest project in this field to make sure of EU assistance funds.Moreover, it is also the key project directly tackling the problem of transportation-generated air pollution, which has been increasing in Warsaw the last couple of years.As to technical innovations, the aspect worth mentioning is the use of opportunity charging (also a novelty in central and eastern Europe) in the form of 19 aerial chargers, which are located at the end of bus lines. Due to the high power of these chargers (200-400 kW) buses do not take additional time to charge: their stops at the end of the bus lines last just as long as they do with diesel buses.<strong>What are the CO2 reduction goals/achievements?</strong>The fuel consumption of a diesel bus amounts to around 49 dm3/100 km, with CO2 emission of 1300 g/km. This means total CO2 emissions, in life-cycle cost of such a bus (assuming 800,000 km/10 years), amount to as much as 1,040t. Therefore, with 130 e-buses in the Warsaw project, the resulting total reduction of on-road CO2 emissions will equal 135,200t, which is a very significant number.  <strong>Next steps </strong>Public opinion in Poland is still mostly wary of electric mobility, considering expensive electric vehicles to be something of a waste of money. However, passengers were positive about the electric buses that went into operation in Warsaw even before the current project began. They appreciated the noise reduction provided by such vehicles and the lack of pollutants generated by their propulsion systems. Therefore, after the first three batches of 10-12m e-buses, the City of Warsaw and MZA decided to implement the larger project which included up to 130 18m buses to be purchased over 2019-2020. It is also hoped that the operation of these longer buses will turn out successfully and help convince more passengers of the strengths of e-mobility. Dissemination activities about e-buses are also taking place among with Polish cities and bus operators. Further purchases of electric buses for Warsaw are planned for after 2020 as well.<strong>Financial savings </strong>Estimated fuel costs (LCC, 800,000 km/10 years) for one diesel bus amount to 417,233 USD, while for an e-bus it is 100,195 USD. For 130 vehicles this amounts to 54,240,290 USD/13,025,365 USD, representing an advantage of 41,214,925 USD for e-buses. Their disadvantage is their purchase price: (130×580,076 USD)-(130×290,038 USD)=37,705,004 USD. This means a total advantage of 3,509,921 USD for electric vehicles. Taking into account the total costs of the project/co-funding, the total advantage of the project when it comes to the budget rises to 36,882,198 USD.<strong>Key impact </strong>Within the duration of the project, the avoided emissions of non-methane volatile organic compound will amount to 20,987t/year. The avoided emissions of NOx will equal 124,133t/year, while of SO2 – 49,407t/year and of PM2.5 – 0.139 t/year. The combined avoided emissions for 10 years of bus LCC would amount to: 209,87t of NVMOC, 1,241,33t of NOx, 494,07t of SO2 and 1,39t of PM 2.5.  In turn, environmental costs (including both health costs, material damages and environmental damages) saved due to reducing the emissions described above over the first full 10 years of the project’s duration (2020-2029) will vary from 3,761,799 USD/year to 4,831,833 USD/year. In total these 10-year savings will amount to 42,863,220 USD.<strong>Links to further information </strong><a href="http://www.mza.waw.pl/spolka-mza/projekt-zakupu-elektrycznych-autobusow">http://www.mza.waw.pl/spolka-mza/projekt-zakupu-elektrycznych-autobusow</a><a href="http://www.c40.org/blog_posts/expert-voices-marcin-wroblewski-chief-specialist-city-of-warsaw-on-the-city-s-policy-concerning-clean-buses">http://www.c40.org/blog_posts/expert-voices-marcin-wroblewski-chief-specialist-city-of-warsaw-on-the-city-s-policy-concerning-clean-buses</a><strong>Contact details</strong>City of Warsaw – Infrastructure Department

Wuhan Intelligent Parking Service System
#################################################################################

            February 2018        The Wuhan intelligent parking system has four operating units: the parking lot detector, the Watertek intelligent terminal, ETC technology and a smart mobile app. Parking lot detection is made possible by an earth inductor installed in the parking lot which can automatically detect cars entering and exiting the parking lot and transmit a signal to the back-end in order to automate the payment process. The Watertek intelligent terminal is designed to be a road inspector. When a driver doesn’t pay after parking for over 15 minutes, the intelligent terminal will alert the inspector. The inspector can instruct the driver to pay, take a photo and check the driver’s information. There are 7 ways for drivers to pay parking fee: APP, We-chat official account, Ali-pay, telephone, outlet and supplementary payment through site inspector.The system is used on 435 toll roads and in 31, 700 parking lots. Another 13,000 parking lots are in a trial period. Eleven districts in the city of Wuhan have been covered by the program: Jiangan, Jianghan, Qiaokou, Hanyang, Wuchang, Hongshan ,Qingshan, the Wuhan Economic Development Zone, the East Lake Economic Development Zone, the East Lake Ecological Resorts and the Wuhan Chemical Industry Zone.  Use of the parking lot without making a payment will result in fines: a company offender will be subject to a fine 10,000 RMB and an individual offender will be subjec to a fine of 1,000 RMB.According to statistics from the back-end of the Wuhan Intelligent Parking Service System， since its trial run in Sept. 29th, the daily average car parking has reached 60,000 and the parking lot turnaround rate has been stayed at around 500%, approaching 600% at peak hours.

Implementation of solar PV in Guangzhou
#################################################################################

            January 2018        Guangzhou is actively researching and developing a set of policies that supports the development of solar PV. In 2013, Guangzhou Conghua Pearl Industrial Park was recognised as one of the first 18 national demonstration zones for large-scale implementation of distributed solar photovoltaic power generation. In 2014, the city released a series of documents, including “Development Plan for Distributed Solar PV in Guangzhou,” “Working Plan for Promotion and Implementation of Distributed Solar PV in Guangzhou,” and “Management of Distributed Solar PV Projects in Guangzhou.” These documents simplified the processes of accreditation, grid connection, and subsidy application. They also set out the goals for each district of Guangzhou in terms of solar PV projects.In 2017, Guangzhou published the “Regulations on Utilising the Emerging Industries Development Fund for Solar PV Projects” and provided subsidies (0.2 yuan per watt of installed capacity or 0.15 yuan per kWh of electricity actually generated). Guangzhou also encouraged industrial and commercial enterprises, public institutions, and citizens to take advantage of their rooftops for the exploitation of solar energy. In the first half of 2017, the overall installed capacity of solar PV reached 220,000 kilowatts, amongst which the capacity of household solar PV stood at 1800 kilowatts with 260 household projects. Between 2014 and 2017, 37.83 million yuan of municipal special fund was granted to 162 solar PV projects.Guangzhou will support the implementation of the “Development Plan for Distributed Solar PV in Guangzhou” and “Management of Distributed Solar PV Projects in Guangzhou” as well as give financial support to solar PV projects. The goal is to reach 2 million kilowatts of installed capacity by 2020.

Wuhan Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction in Wuhan Tianhe Airport Terminal 3
#################################################################################

            November 2017        In terms of building energy conservation, Terminal 3’s transparent glass facade serves as ventilation and as a sun-shading structure. In the summertime, flowing air will remove surface heat, greatly reducing heat radiation. The roof of Terminal 3 is flat, making it conducive to the installation of solar panels which can collect thermal energy and provide power for lighting systems in some areas and working zones. Light conducting devices are used to bring natural lighting into underground and inside of the Terminal; waste heat from lighting and ventilating exhaust ducts are recovered; Exxon ABJ plate heat exchangers are used to minimize AC heat exchange energy consumption; and underground water resources and ground source heat pump air conditioners are used to provide auxiliary heating and save operating costs.In order to recycle rainwater, Terminal 3 has adopted a roof rainwater collection system. Reclaimed water are used to flush the road, irrigate plants and save water resources. The andscaping area of terminal 3 is around 850,000 m2, consisting of one axis, one core and two wings. The axis refers to the greening of the main access point to the airport. The core stands for the greening of the areas around the transport center. And the two wings refers to the road greening efforts in the south and north areas of the terminal. Greening area for main access is about 240,000 m2. Public greening area of terminal is around 270,000 m2. Green area of roof garden of transport center is around 59,000 m2. Indoor greening area of terminal is around 22,000 m2. According to investigation, the dust reduction rate within  landscaping areas can reach 37%~60% and noise mitigation can reach 10~20 dB.

Sustainable Urban Development Area "Erlenmatt“
#################################################################################

            November 2017        <strong>Sustainable urban development</strong>The former freight yard of the German Railway station in northern Kleinbasel was one of the last construction land reserves in the Canton Basel-Stadt. Starting in 1998 and over a period of 20 years, this area of 19 hectares has been turned into the neighbourhood “Erlenmatt”. In accordance with the principles of sustainable neighbourhood development, Erlenmatt includes over 1400 apartments for a variety of demands, generously open and attractive green spaces, office and business areas, a primary school and a kindergarten, as well as shopping, gastronomy, and a recreational trend sports centre – everything that’s needed for a modern and comfortable life in Basel. The public Erlenmattpark is the heart of the new neighbourhood, with 5 hectares of green and open parkland situated between the buildings. It is part of a green passageway that leads to the nearby river Wiese and the local recreational area Lange Erlen. Walking and cycling in general are encouraged and incentivised, whereas motorised individual traffic in the area is restricted.<strong>2000 Watt Society: Erlenmatt West </strong>Erlenmatt West provides a total of 574 apartments, commercial real estate, a centre for the elderly with 63 apartments as well as facilities for 56 elderly patients of nursing care and a public restaurant. The entire area Erlenmatt is connected to 100% carbon-neutral long-distance heating and warm water by the Basel energy provider IWB. IWB long distance heating is mostly generated through a waste-to-energy incineration plant as well as a wood power plant. It is Switzerland’s largest long distance heating network. Furthermore, the green roofs of Erlenmatt are equipped with photo-voltaic panels. The neighbourhood is well connected to public transport and is within walking distance to the long distance railway station of the Deutsche Bahn. The area has charging stations for electric vehicles as well as nearby stations of the nation-wide car-sharing service Mobility.Furthermore a free app for tenants supplies a variety of relevant information about the neighbourhood and their individual apartments, such as instruction manuals for appliances or contact details for facility management. The app encourages social interaction through a community billboard where people can post upcoming events or offer things no longer used. The app also allows users to track their energy usage and to compare themselves to the average in the neighbourhood. This is supposed to incentivise people to adapt their usage of energy and to even trigger their competitiveness to use less energy. <strong>Current development: Erlenmatt Ost</strong><img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA2OTQ5IDQ2MzgiIHdpZHRoPSI2OTQ5IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjQ2MzgiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYzQwLm9yZyUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZzdGF0aWMlMkZvdGhlcl91cGxvYWRzJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGMTQzM19fUEIwNDY2My5vcmlnaW5hbC5qcGclM0YxNTA5NTY4MDIzIiBkYXRhLXc9IjY5NDkiIGRhdGEtaD0iNDYzOCIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+"/>© Bau- und Verkehrsdepartement Basel-Stadt <img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA2NjkzIDQ0NjciIHdpZHRoPSI2NjkzIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjQ0NjciIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYzQwLm9yZyUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZzdGF0aWMlMkZvdGhlcl91cGxvYWRzJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGMTQzNF9fUEIwNDY3Mi5vcmlnaW5hbC5qcGclM0YxNTA5NTY4MzQzIiBkYXRhLXc9IjY2OTMiIGRhdGEtaD0iNDQ2NyIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+"/>© Bau- und Verkehrsdepartement Basel-Stadt <strong>Further contact: </strong>

100 Resilient Cities Pilot Project: Community Based Interventions to Improve River Health (Aller River)
#################################################################################

            September 2017        The Take Back Our Rivers project (TBOR) is an initiative of eThekwini Conservancies Forum (ECF) that seeks to restore the river health of selected rivers in the eThekwini Municipal Area through rehabilitation and restoration strategies. The Environmental Planning and Climate Protection Department (EPCPD) partnered with ECF, through the Kloof Conservancy to pilot the TBOR project in the Aller River, which passes through the areas of New Germany and Clermont. The purpose of the pilot was to explore community-based interventions to improve river health. Some of the project key successes include, a cohort of well-trained young people that are working in the Aller River undertaking waste clean-up and river monitoring, improved river health, stakeholder engagement, establishment of cross-departmental collaboration (e.g. involvement of Water and Sanitation and Health departments in the monitoring of river health), and various awareness programme with the local schools, communities and local non-governmental organization partners.IntroductionAt the end of 2013, Durban was selected as one of the first 32 cities to be included in the Rockefeller Foundation’s international 100 Resilient Cities Programme (hereafter referred to as 100RC). A key output from Durban’s participation in 100RC is the development of a ‘Resilience Strategy’ for Durban which is currently being finalized. Durban’s resilience journey began with a scoping and research phase in 2014 to understand some of the key resilience challenges in Durban. A number of issues were identified by Durban stakeholders as playing a critical role in either enhancing or undermining resilience through a number of stakeholder engagement processes.Some of the key ideas that emerged from this process were as follows;a)  Environment: The importance of the natural environment in providing the foundation for human wellbeing, development and resilience. Issues of particular importance related to biodiversity, water and climate change and the need to address these as part of Durban’s resilience strategy.b)   Active and engaged citizens: The resilience work highlighted the fact that government cannot work alone to implement what is needed to build a resilient city. Citizens who are active and engaged have a key role to play in mobilizing local action and contributing towards broader resilience objectives for the city.c)   Capacity building: Capacity building plays a key role in creating awareness, building knowledge and equipping citizens with the skills they need to find employment and to contribute towards building a resilient society and economy. Pilot projects have been initiated through the 100RC programme to explore some of the ideas that have emerged and to understand what will be required to implement them. The Take Back Our Rivers pilot project provided an opportunity to test ways in which to address the three resilience issues described above, simultaneously. The ‘Take Back Our Rivers’ initiative flagship project of the Kloof Conservancy project seeks to restore the river health of selected rivers across eThekwini Municipality, through river assessments, rehabilitation and various restoration strategies and resource mobilization for implementation.  Whilst the ‘Take Back our Rivers’ initiative is being coordinated by the Kloof Conservancy, it is important to stress that this is a project of the eThekwini Conservancies Forum (ECF). ECF is part of the regional node of conservancies ‘Conservation KZN’ and represents all conservancies in the eThekwini Municipal Area. The pilot was implemented on the 5.8 km stretch of the Aller River, which passes through New Germany and Clermont. The piloted area is situated across different communities (middle class residential area; industrial area; and low income/informal housing), and provided an opportunity to mobilize diverse members of the community living alongside the river to ensure the sustainability of the work.The pilot project approach provided an opportunity to assess how river ecosystems can be managed and monitored through active engagement of citizens who have been appropriately capacitated to undertake the work that is required, thereby contributing towards building a resilient and sustainable city.Key successes and lessons learnt in this pilot have been:a)  b)  c)  d)  e)  f)  g)  There have been a number of successes achieved in this project implementation, but it is acknowledged that a year is not enough for a project of this magnitude. Therefore, more funding is still required to maintain a clean, alien invasive free Aller River and to sustain the work that the Eco-Champs do. The funding provided by eThekwini Municipality during the pilot project enabled the project team to leverage funding for phase 2 of the project from Cambridge University. The Cambridge University funding will fund the project from June 2017 until January 2018. There is significant potential to incorporate the TBOR approach to be applied to other rivers. This comprehensive project concept could be adopted and adapted into the Palmiet Rehabilitation Pilot Project (PRP), which has received funding from Aqueduct Program. The money is to be used towards the rehabilitation of ecological infrastructure within the catchment.The Palmiet Rehabilitation Project is a climate change adaptation oriented project. The project primarily focuses on conservation, rehabilitation & restoration of natural systems within the catchment to improve river health and surrounding community resilience. The Climate Protection Branch within the EPCPD, which oversee the PRP is pursuing a similar partnership with the Kloof Conservancy to replicate and upscale the Aller River concept into the Palmiet Catchment as an approach to implement the project.There is a summary video on the Aller River Project on YouTube.

Durban's Energy Office Solar (EOS) Project
#################################################################################

            September 2017        The Energy Office Solar (EOS) project is a pilot project that culminated in the eThekwini Municipality installing 300 kWp of rooftop Photovoltaic on 5 municipal owned rooftops. This pilot project was undertaken in part to test the regulations and processes that the Municipality has put in place for the private sector to adhere to when installing Rooftop PV.The EOS project has its roots in the Durban Climate Change Strategy (DCCS). The DCCS was approved by the eThekwini Municipal Council in 2015. It was developed through a consultative and participatory approach which revolves around thematic areas. One of the thematic areas is Energy, the first objective of this theme is “40% of Durban’s electricity consumption is supplied from renewable energy by 2030 in line with the national long term mitigation targets”. One of the specific responses that will enable us to achieve that objective is “Implement viable small-scale renewable energy generation such as micro-hydropower, rooftop solar photovoltaic and anaerobic digesters within municipal assets”The EOS project came to life when a 2-page funding request was made to the eThekwini Municipal Treasury Cluster. Initially, the EOS project was based on a solar charging station for Electric Vehicles (EV). However, that EV solar charging station concept was redeveloped into a Rooftop PV project due to the low penetration of EVs in eThekwini Municipality at the time.The identification of suitable buildings for this pilot posed a few challenges, as the Municipality owns thousands of facilities. A long list of 18 buildings was created and further shortened by utilising criteria such as visibility of the building, available roof space, global irradiance and electricity consumption. The shortlisting process resulted in 6 buildings being identified for installation, these buildings are uShaka Marine World, Water and Sanitation Headquarters, Metro Police Headquarters, Moses Mabhida Stadium Arch, People’s Park Café and Loram House (which was later removed due to structural concerns).Polycrystalline PV panels are utilised because the modules have a longer proven track record than thin-film and are more cost-effective than monocrystalline. The system is well equipped with P300 and P600 Power optimizers to operate at 99.5% maximum efficiency and able to record real-time performance measurement. Four of the five buildings utilise Solar Edge technology which differs from conventional string inverters as it uses optimizers on each solar panels. The ABB conventional string inverter has been installed in the remaining Municipal owned building that is part of this project. The systems are well equipped with built-in communication functionality. The performance of modules, string and inverters can be well managed and controlled to achieve required production performance ratio. The system can also be responsive when parameters are operating far below the required specification. In the event of an emergency the system is designed to respond and shut down electric flows. The designed generation capability of the various systems are as follows, with corresponding GHG reductions per annum: uShaka Marine World (165.4 MWh/yr, 170,4 tCO2e/yr), Water and Sanitation Headquarters (76.7 MWh/yr, 79 tCO2e/yr), Metro Police Headquarters (137.4 MWh/yr, 141.5 tCO2e/yr), Moses Mabhida Stadium Arch (6.8 MWh/yr, 7 tCO2e/yr), People’s Park Café (40.4 MWh/yr, 41.6 tCO2e/yr).In our context, consultation was one of the critical elements that would determine the success of the project. Some of the critical stakeholders are mentioned below, most are part of the eThekwini Municipality as an organisation: Architecture Department (All work on Municipal buildings needs to go through Architecture Department or get approved by them); Electricity Unit (for connection to the electrical grid), Planning Unit (for minor building works approval), and the relevant building managers (for maintenance and safety issues). In addition, Amafa, the heritage body for Kwa-Zulu Natal, had to be consulted as the Loram House building is classified as a Heritage building – as a result no work can be undertaken on the building without Amafa’s consent. Other stakeholders included the consultant and contractor. Communication needs to be as inclusive as possible – this will mitigate not taking into account the needs or regulations of some departments. It is also essential to have an efficient document management system, particularly for the easy access of compliance documents post installation.Alignment of the  Tender Document that is issued to assessment reports needs to be given special attention, due to the fact that once a tender is entered into with the contractor it does not leave much room to deviate and the Supply Chain Management process to make changes to the contract is often time consuming, which will delay the project.As a coastal city, we had to pay special attention to the metal protection measures that were utilised for the installation. In the case of uShaka Marine, the installation is less than 75m from the surf, making it a very corrosive environment.Installing PV is the first main milestone, it is not the only milestone. Thought needs to be given to monitoring the installation, which includes tracking yield – this is best done through a real-time cloud based system, certain systems will also allow you to locate faults within minutes. Manually collecting data is inefficient and you will have lost days, if not weeks between a fault, identification of a fault and rectification of the fault.Maintenance also needs to be catered for, it should not be taken for granted that the building managers will automatically maintain the system. This is best addressed by the contractor maintaining the system over a year or 2, and gradually handing over the maintenance aspects to the facility managers.Training needs to be targeted at the facility managers and supervisors. This will likely be new technology for them and a thorough understanding will allow them to trouble shoot minor issues.Such an installation is a good opportunity for an awareness campaign, not only so that broader building stakeholders are aware of the installation but also the opportunity is taken to drive home the Renewable Energy message, which is linked to greenhouse gas emissions reduction and climate change.It is important to note that PV panels do not stop generating DC, as a result the necessary precautions and regulations have to be followed closely. The necessary isolation measures need to be included. For example, in the event of a fire, normally the Firemen switch off electricity supply to the building – but without the necessary notifications and isolations mechanisms the PV panel will still be generating DC and pushing it through the system which poses a risk for emergency personnel.All installations were commissioned between December 2016 and January 2017. We are currently monitoring the generation data from all installations. This data will determine the feasibility of rooftop PV in Durban, should the figures be favourable it will be utilised as the core of the motivation for Phase 2 for EOS. Phase 2 is envisaged to be more of a programme, rather than a project and see the rollout of rooftop PV to a larger number of municipal owned facilities.At the same time the data will also be packaged to promote the installation of rooftop PV by private sector property owners. Naturally the private sector has a larger potential for the installation of rooftop PV because of the larger number of buildings owned as compared to municipal owned facilities.eThekwini Municipality, Energy OfficeSibusiso Ntshalintshali, Renewable Energy ManagerTel. +27 31 322 2634<a href="mailto:Sbu.ntshalinsthali@durban.gov.za">Sbu.ntshalinsthali@durban.gov.za</a>

Istanbul Floating Solar Power Plant
#################################################################################

            September 2017        The Floating Solar Power Plant Project aims to make use of the currently unused space on top of freshwater sources to produce renewable energy to meet the increasing need for electricity in the city, through installation of floating solar panels. The current capacity of the project is at 240 kWp, but moving forward will be scaled upwards to 10 MWp, saving up to 7,800 tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum.Istanbul has started an extremely ambitious project in committing to expand the City’s own renewable energy supply, by placing floating solar panels on water surfaces by the Büyükçekmece dam, which will generate electricity for the national electricity grid, making use of the unused space on the city’s water basins and ponds.The project uses solar panels which can float on the surface of a body of water. These solar panels will then feed electricity into the power grid to be used by the city, replacing the need for fossil fuel intensive energy production and providing greater electricity capacity. This floating solar power plant will make the use of otherwise un-useable space. The project has been launched in 2016 on a small scale with a capacity of around 240 kWp, which then will be expanded over the following 3 years to have a total capacity of 10 MWp, capable of completely replacing the electricity consumption of 2,400 homes.The project is one of the most ambitious to-date taken by the City of Istanbul. The current project is at the R&D phase and produces 240 kWp, which is preventing 210 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. When the project has been expanded to its full capacity it will be able to produce 10 MWp, with the ability to reduce carbon emissions by 7,800 tons per annum from 2019.Furthermore, this project will produce several environmental co-benefits such as significantly reducing the rate of evapo-transpiration of water bodies which are used for public drinking water, reducing the need for finding additional water sources, or spending additional resources ensuring providing water filtration. Reducing algae growth through reduced light levels will also significantly improve water quality, which in turn can benefit public health.   This project itself will be expanded over the next three years, moving from the R&D phase to total planned capacity of 10 MWp. The power plant on the Büyükçekmece dam is just one of three that are currently planned, with expansion to Terkos and Ömerli dams to be installed by 2022. Solar power potential from these 3 dams make up just 1.25% of the total potential of the city, and beyond 2022, there is scope for further projects.Name: Zühtü ÇELENKPosition: Project & Corporate Development ManagerEmail: Tel. 00902122193976

A primary role of KSEF was to achieve integration and stimulate communication between government, private business, research institutions and various other stakeholders.  While it is extremely difficult to calculate the exact greenhouse gas emission reduction from initiatives like KSEF emissions, it is important to note that KSEF has played a critical catalytic role in the sector.The mission statement of KSEF is “…to facilitate the development and growth of the sustainable energy sector in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa through information dissemination, facilitation of networking within the sector and implementation of enabling projects”.The vision of KSEF is “…for KwaZulu-Natal to have a vibrant sustainable energy sector  that provides a range of goods and services that reduce the environmental impact of energy provision, assists in the creation of local economic opportunities and facilitates broad access to energy”.KSEF’s primary objectives are:1. The promotion of the Sustainable Energy Sector in KwaZulu-Natal by facilitating stakeholder engagement, networking and information sharing, and by providing a platform for both private  sector and public sector stakeholders including researchers, investors and civil society to engage around opportunities and challenges in the sector.2. The promotion of, and education, and training programmes relating to environmental awareness, greening and sustainable development projects, with a focus on renewable energy and energy efficiency.3. Research including agricultural, economic, industrial, social, scientific and technological research with a focus on renewable energy and energy efficiency.4. The provision of training, support or assistance to communicate based projects relating to self-help, empowerment, capacity building, skills development or anti-poverty.5. The provision of training, support or assistance to emerging micro enterprises to improve capacity to start and manage businesses in the sustainable energy sector.6. The development, servicing, upgrading, conversion or procurement of stands or the provision of building materials which address the issue of energy poverty, energy access and affordability for the benefit of persons whose monthly household income is equal to or less than R 7,500 or any greater amount determines by the Income Tax Act.KSEF was initiated as early as May 2010, at a Renewable Energy Research Seminar hosted by Imagine Durban and the eThekwini Energy Office, the first KSEF meeting. At that Seminar a terms of reference for KSEF was discussed, which was further developed by the Energy Office and Imagine Durban. The Terms of Reference was accepted by the participants of the second KSEF meeting in October 2010.KSEF was initially co-funded by the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) and the eThekwini Municipality, Energy Office.  The funding was utilised to host quarterly KSEF meetings and to engage the services of a ‘Forum Manager’.The main purpose of the quarterly KSEF meetings were to introduce and discuss sustainable energy projects that were earmarked for KwaZulu-Natal, and thereafter guide and coordinate the effective implementation of these projects. In addition, it was envisaged that the dialogue and initiatives of KSEF would improve economic productivity, increase local production an investment in further research.The Forum manager was tasked with the following:1.  Strategic interventions in Research and Development, Manufacturing, and Market penetration.2. Management Activities:3. Reporting Activities:When the contract of the Forum Manager ended in 2014, a decision was taken to convert KSEF from a Municipal Project to a separate entity in the form of a Not-for-Profit Company.Since the conversion of KSEF into a not-for-profit company, all operations ground to a halt. This is primarily due to initial Board of Director not properly registering KSEF as a not-for-profit company, which resulted in KSEF’s inability to raise funding to undertake it’s functions.The subsequent leadership has since rectified the situation and KSEF is being restarted.Key lessons learnt including the following:1. Consultation is critical for the establishment of such a forum, as everyone needs to take ownership of it. In addition, the consultation will allow the purpose of forums to directly address real challenges and opportunities, not some theoretical aspect.2. Certain types of Forums/initiatives cannot be structured to be self-funding, they inherently do not provide services that can be marketed as sellable but provide an invaluable function for the industry.3. Selecting the correct people to lead such a forum is vitally important, people with the correction motivations, dedication and energy should be identified – even though they will not get remunerated.The immediate next step is to restart KSEF, this will necessitate the following: finalisation of re-registration with CIPC and SARS. Thereafter KSEF will be in a position to receive funding to begin with their scope of work.Current Chair, KSEF<a href="mailto:shaun@impact-ep.co.za">shaun@impact-ep.co.za</a>Energy Office, eThekwini Municipality<a href="mailto:Magash.Naidoo@durban.gov.za">Magash.Naidoo@durban.gov.za</a>

Hıdayet Turkoğlu Sports Complex, Istanbul: large-scale solar power retrofit to cover electricity demand
#################################################################################

            September 2017        This pilot programme which ran over 2016, is one of the first solar retrofitting projects orchestrated by the metropolitan municipality of Istanbul, and the first time that a sports facility will generate renewable energy. This project has been beneficial both economically and environmentally, saving significant quantities of carbon dioxide and providing significant annual economic savings to the City, meaning that the programme can be cost neutral in less than 25 years.The project involved installing 650 unit-solar energy power systems onto the roof of the Hıdayet Turkoğlu Sports Complex, where the electricity produced by the solar panels will be directly consumed by the sports complex, thereby reducing the amount of electricity taken from the carbon intensive national grid.This pilot project is designed to be the first of many projects from the Metropolitan Municipality of Istanbul, aimed at reducing the City of Istanbul’s CO2 emissions, reducing the risk of dangerous climate change and decreasing the vulnerability of the City’s infrastructure to acute and chronic shocks from climate impacts. This project will decarbonise around 10.33% of the electricity consumption of the Hıdayet Turkoğlu Sports Complex, saving approximately 105 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, the equivalent of planting 255 trees.This will be the first of many projects looking to reduce carbon emissions of the City of Istanbul, and with the Metropolitan Municipality committed to produce its own renewable energy, these projects will continue to flourish. The municipality wishes to better design the City and buildings to ensure that in the future, they can produce their own energy. This pilot project has allowed the City to learn a number of lessons and helped to build the skills to be able to further invest in clean, green and renewable energy, scaling the ambitions City-wide.Name: Sefer MeŞePosition: Industrial EngineerEmail Address: Phone Number: +90 212 449 93 62

The Bahnstadt Project in Heidelberg 
#################################################################################

            September 2017        A new city district of 116 hectares is growing on an abandoned area of a former freight yard in Heidelberg. This area will be transformed into a district which is being developed considering multiple aspects of environmental protection. 5,000 citizens will find a place to live and 7,000 new jobs will be created. This development is an on-going process which started in the year 2008 and is scheduled for completion in 2022. To date most of the areas are sold and the majority of the planned residential buildings has already been constructed. The main project idea has always been to create a mixed space for living, research and work. Accordingly, some office buildings and trade facilities were built in parallel with the residential buildings and are being used by high-tech and science companies. <b>The Energy Concept of Heidelberg Bahnstadt</b>The second and perhaps even more outstanding idea has been to create a showcase-district to prove the feasibility of high energy-efficient building and a sustainable energy supply. All buildings in Bahnstadt have to be constructed in accordance with the Passive House Standard. A dense insulation of walls, roofs and windows keeps the heat inside the buildings. The orientation determined by the sun helps to use as much solar power as possible for passive heating. A well elaborated ventilation system with heat recovery offers a high air quality and uses the warm exhaust air to heat up the fresh air, again saving energy. The threshold to become a passive house is an overall energy demand for heating of maximum 15 kWh per m² per year (approximately 10% of the average heat demand of the existing building stock in Germany). To implement these ideas in the construction of new buildings, all partners (municipal institutions, investors, developers, architects, engineers, construction workers) were informed about challenges during construction. An evaluation of the energy consumption after the first two years in usage showed that the energy demand of the residential buildings in Bahnstadt complies with the Passive House Standard and the feedback of the inhabitants is mainly positive. The City of Heidelberg aims to supply the energy still needed in a CO<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyMDAwIDExMjUiIHdpZHRoPSIyMDAwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjExMjUiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYzQwLm9yZyUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZzdGF0aWMlMkZvdGhlcl91cGxvYWRzJTJGaW1hZ2VzJTJGMTMyNF9IZWlkZWxiZXJnX0JhaG5zdGFkdC5vcmlnaW5hbC5KUEclM0YxNTA1OTM4NTEwIiBkYXRhLXc9IjIwMDAiIGRhdGEtaD0iMTEyNSIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+"/>View of one of three daycare centres in Bahnstadt and one of the main squares “Schwetzinger Terasse”; Photo credit Stadt Heidelberg/Ralf Bermich<b>Environmental Protection Measures in Heidelberg Bahnstadt</b>However, the high energy-efficiency standard is not the only aspect of environmental protection borne in mind during the development of the Bahnstadt district.A sophisticated soil management scheme helped to reduce the impact of transportation to and from the construction site. Soil removed from areas where construction is in progress was transferred to areas where no construction was going on, but remained inside the project area. Due to this, no lorries where driving through the existing city districts. Fuel saving and a minimum impact on the surrounding population were the results.Another environmental issue accompanying all bigger construction projects is soil sealing. Sealed areas have an impact on the ground water depletion and lead to problems with the handling of rain water on surfaces. A rainwater management system is employed that helps to maintain the natural functions of the soil, with an increased proportion of rainwater being allowed to evaporate and benefiting the local climate. Therefore 66% of the flat roofs have to be equipped with an extensive green roof where up to 70% of the rain water is stored and from where it evaporates at higher temperatures. Additionally, a 710 m long pond system collects and stores water. The remaining rainwater is infiltrated into ground water.For more than one decade the area had been abandoned and not maintained. This led to the development of a rich flora and fauna including some rare and protected species (especially lizards). Prior to the start of the construction work, amongst others, thousands of sand and common wall lizards were relocated to specially created new habitats. Areas that are of importance to local ecosystems are deliberately being undeveloped. The greened roofs (see above) also provide new habitats for plants and animals.  <b>Project Status and Outlook</b>Only five years after the construction of the first residential building, 3,200 inhabitants are living in the new district. On an area of 243,000 m² constructions are finished or in progress. One third of this area is public green space. 168,087 m² heated floor area with 106,879 m² for living highlight the importance of the Bahnstadt district to improve the housing situation in Heidelberg. The second phase of the project will be dominated by the construction of non-residential buildings. These will include schools, shopping malls, a cinema, recreation centers, an international convention center, buildings with space for laboratories and offices. As all of those are non-standardized buildings, it is even more important for the municipal offices to communicate continuously with investors and architects to ensure the high energy efficiency standard of the building and therefor to minimize the carbon footprint of a whole urban district.<strong>Contact Data: </strong>City of HeidelbergOffice of Environmental Protection, Trade Supervision and EnergyKornmarkt 169117 HeidelbergEmail: Phone: Ask for: Ralf Bermich; Robert Persch, Fabian Nagel

Cities100: Istanbul - Circular Design Approach for Processing Waste
#################################################################################

            September 2017        Istanbul's circular design approach to waste management allows the city to produce electricity and compost from different waste streams, as well as divert excess heat to greenhouses for greater productivity.Istanbul faces a serious air pollution challenge, with particulate levels consistently above the WHO recommended level. Smart designs for heating and cooling that do not create extra pollution such as the greenhouse project are needed to reduce health risks for citizens.Istanbul's Odayeri waste management site is not only large, varied, and capable of processing 12,000 tons of waste per day, but also has a strong focus on environmental protection and tapping the potential resources for new growth. The 266-hectare site is dedicated to many different waste streams including municipal, medical, and organic waste. Landfill sites are isolated from groundwater using natural and geotechnical membranes, and drainage lines exist to collect methane gas produced over time. There is also a waste-to-energy plant with a capacity of 35 MW, enough to power 130,000 families for a year, which also produces heat as a by-product. Rather than let this go to waste, the heat is captured and sent to a nearby 3,200 m2 greenhouse for increased productivity. The organic waste processing area also produces compost for the greenhouse, which grows 600,000 flowers per month for the city's parks and gardens.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Tshwane - Private Funding Creates Recycling Park and Green Jobs
#################################################################################

            September 2017        The Atteridgeville Recycling Park is the first multi-waste stream recycling facility developed via a public-private partnership in South Africa.More than 10 million tons of CO2 equivalent emissions come from Tshwane's current landfilling practices annually. The city is rapidly running out of landfill space, and it does not have the required capital to develop recycling infrastructure. Private sector funding has offered a solution to develop advanced recycling centers.The Atteridgeville Recycling Park (ARP) is being developed on public land in Tshwane with private financing through a novel 'build, operate, and transfer'agreement. The concessionaire, New GX Enviro, will operate the facility for 15 years, before ownership of the waste management facility reverts to the city at no cost. Two phases of the ARP have been completed so far, the material recovery facility, and the garden waste composting facility. These represent $5.2 million of a planned $16.4 million investment. The next phases are a municipal waste screening facility, which will separate organic and inorganic waste, and a construction and demolition waste disposal facility. The facility will serve 300,000 households in the surrounding regions and divert waste from landfill. It is also creating permanent jobs for the people of Atteridgeville, a historically disadvantaged area.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Toronto - On the Road to Zero Waste
#################################################################################

            September 2017        With a new waste management strategy in place, Toronto will divert the majority of its waste from landfills and eventually become a zero-waste city.By sending 50% of its residential waste to the city's landfill, Toronto is looking at a full landfill by 2029. The new waste management strategy will extend the landfill's life and help Toronto take its first steps towards a zero-waste future.Two years after its launch, Toronto's Long Term Waste Management Strategy's overall focus is to divert as much waste as possible from landfill. To do so, the strategy recommends waste reduction, reuse, recycling, recovery, and residual disposal policies and programs, also known as the “5Rs” that are environmentally sustainable, socially acceptable, and cost-effective. The strategy will assist Canada's most populous city in achieving a 70% residential diversion rate. By working with community partners and leveraging existing social infrastructure, Toronto aims to divert an additional 200,000 metric tons of waste from landfill by 2026. Toronto is also developing a pilot program to capture natural gas generated at the city's anaerobic digestion facility, which would reduce 100,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions annually. The strategy is included in Toronto's Climate Change Action Plan, and will assist the city in reaching its goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% in 2050.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Hong Kong - Energy-Positive Wastewater Sludge Treatment
#################################################################################

            September 2017        T.PARK is the world's largest wastewater sludge incineration plant, self-sufficient and designed to convert all of Hong Kong's sludge into space-saving ash and renewable energy.Hong Kong's sewage production is expected to grow significantly due to a growing population. A further challenge is that the city's buildings account for 90% of electricity consumption and 60% of the carbon emissions.As the first large-scale waste-to-energy facility in Hong Kong, T.PARK is a key environmental infrastructure project in the city's “Climate Action Plan 2030+”. The plant uses fluidized bed incineration to process wastewater sludge from the large sewage treatment works in the city. With a total capacity of 2,000 tons of sludge per day, it will meet the needs of the city beyond 2030. Previously, the wet and energy-rich sludge was dumped in landfills. With incineration at T.PARK, the residual ash uses 90% less landfill volume, and CO2 emissions from landfilling are significantly reduced. The process also generates renewable energy to power the plant and export to the city's grid.The entire facility has been built as a model for sustainability. Drinking water is provided by a desalination plant and rainwater is collected for non-potable uses. All wastewater generated within the facility is treated on site for reuse, resulting in zero effluent discharge to the sea. There is also an Environmental Education Centre equipped with leisure, educational, and landscaped facilities, including a spa, exhibition halls, upcycling showrooms, wetland garden, and bird sanctuary.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Santiago - Local Recycling Centers Boost the Recycling Rate
#################################################################################

            September 2017        Santiago is increasing the rate of recycling by building local centers that benefit the local environment and entrepreneurship.A lack of adequate infrastructure and cultural norms have limited Santiago to a 10% recycling rate, according a local survey. The majority of waste ends up in landfills, negatively impacting the lives of mainly low-income communities.The City of Santiago is making it easier for citizens to recycle by implementing so-called 'clean points' where waste can be sorted in order to be reused. A network of points will be built to increase the recycling rate. New equipment and training of personnel will also be used to classify, transport, and eliminate illegal waste disposal in public spaces. An important aspect of the project is the inclusion of 'Base Recyclers' (one-man recycling companies) in the waste network, as their income will increase with more efficient waste collection. The project will create 20 new clean points in 16 municipalities that integrate the pre-treatment processing of waste, facilitating the transport and trade onto processing companies. Existing local recycling initiatives will be strengthened by the local centers, and the project aims to improve economic, social, and environmental measures related to solid waste management. Local governments are free to adapt the approach, so it responds to local market demands, making it an adaptive, flexible waste management system.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Johannesburg - Trash for Cash
#################################################################################

            September 2017        Johannesburg seeks to divert waste from landfill by encouraging communities to run waste co-operatives and pay waste collectors to gather the waste.Johannesburg generates about 1.6 million tons of waste annually, a majority of which goes to landfill. Three out of four landfill sites are approaching their full capacity, with less than 10 years disposal time left. To avoid adding more landfill sites, Johannesburg must move away from a waste-to-landfill model.To cope with a massive waste problem, the City of Johannesburg has initiated a waste strategy. Entrepreneurship is stimulated in the communities by establishing waste buy-back centers, which are operated by communities. The centers buy recyclable waste such as paper, plastic, cans, and glass from people and then sell it to recyclers. Waste collectors receive a direct cash payment according to the volume of cleaned waste they bring in. An important aspect of the initiative is the incorporation of the informal waste collectors. Without the buy-back centers matching supply and demand, waste collectors would have to travel long distances by foot to sell waste. The aim is to empower impoverished communities via business entity ownership and increased recycling rates. There are seven buy-back centers spread across the city, each of which employs 10 to 15 full-time staff as well as 30 more people who indirectly benefit from the centers.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Chennai - Citizen, Public, and Private Engagement in Waste Management
#################################################################################

            September 2017        By targeting public, private, and residential actors, Chennai is experimenting to find the most effective methods for reducing waste, as well as making the most of any waste produced.In 2016, Chennai saw some of the worst floods in its history, and clearing 145,000 tons of waste from the streets after the waters subsided highlighted the extent of the city's rubbish problem. Chennai's new waste management strategy aims to reduce the buildup of waste and realize some of the potential value.Chennai has embarked on a journey to uproot deeply ingrained attitudes towards waste. More than two-thirds of all waste in the city is from residential sources, and of that, 60% is organic, showing that segregation at the source could be a simple and powerful tool for cleaning up the streets. Households throughout the city are now required to segregate their waste, which is then collected and taken to recycling, incineration, or landfill sites. Community meetings, youth club conventions, and social media campaigns were all part of the city's strategy to spread awareness amongst the community, and since the start of the program in 2016, the city has recorded a 2.5% reduction in total waste production. Chennai is no stranger to innovative waste management strategies, in 2002, the infamous Jambulingam Street was laid with shredded-plastic infused tarmac, which has passed the test of time, constant rickshaw turbulence, and monsoon flooding. Now, the government continues to look for innovation from the private sector and is pursuing public-private partnerships for better processing of previously segregated waste.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Bengaluru - Valuable Waste Segregated at Source
#################################################################################

            September 2017        Bengaluru is beginning to clean up its streets with a domestic waste segregation program driven by community volunteers and providing valuable resources for farmers and recycling facilities.Changing public perceptions and behaviors involving waste processing was challenging in a city used to dumping waste on street corners, but more than 2,000 dedicated volunteers, called 'Suchi Mitras', have been responsible for monitoring their local community and ensuring waste is properly disposed of.India's third most populous and second-fastest growing city is leading the way on waste separation and collection. Bengaluru, formerly Bangalore, has transitioned from a system reliant on street corner dumping to a well-organized segregation system in which the municipality collects wet, dry, and sanitary waste on a door-to-door basis across the entire city. Bengaluru is the first city in India to segregate as much as 50% of its waste, and is also the first Indian city to collect sanitary waste separately from households. The collected wet waste is converted into manure compost, which is then given to local farmers in collaboration with the Agriculture and Urban Development ministries. Anyone generating more than 10 kg of waste per day is classified as a bulk waste generator and must either deploy their own waste processing units or use private companies.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Buenos Aires - Changing Food Waste Attitudes and Behavior
#################################################################################

            September 2017        Buenos Aires is tackling the growing challenges of food waste and food shortages with a source-based strategy targeting households, schools, and restaurants.It is estimated that 16 million tonnes of food are thrown away annually in Argentina; meanwhile, 32% of the population lives below the poverty lineThe sustainable urban food strategy in Argentina's capital is reducing food waste sent to landfill. In recent years, the city has been praised for recognizing the importance and rights of informal waste-pickers, as well as processing municipal waste sustainably. But the newest strategy aims to tackle a more culturally ingrained attitude to food waste. Starting in primary schools and working with the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, the city aims to disseminate information about best practices for minimizing and dealing with food waste. The information campaign also focuses on restaurants and communities, where workshops will be held to engage citizens. In addition, the University of Bologna recently launched a survey on food waste in the city, which is the first research of its kind in Latin America.

#################################################################################

            September 2017        An industrial symbiosis program in Cape Town is facilitating waste and CO2 reduction via resource exchanges between companies, and is also encouraging small business development and job creation.South Africa faces challenges with respect to resource use, including its reliance on fossil fuels for energy, water scarcity, and high landfill rates. Industrial symbiosis aims to address this by promoting reuse and recycling of industrial water.The Western Cape Industrial Symbiosis Programme (WISP) is a free business facilitation service based in Cape Town, and is the first industrial symbiosis program in Africa. It connects companies so they can realize the benefits of exchanging underutilized or wasted resources. WISP targets the diversion of all industrial waste from landfill, complementing the city's zero waste to landfill activities. The program also focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, generating financial benefits for companies and creating jobs. WISP has an enterprise development program, which creates new businesses via an incubation program linking entrepreneurs to raw material supply agreements. Workshops have identified more than 4,000 potential synergies between the 486 companies that are part of the WISP network. WISP has also developed an international standard carbon calculator to measure emissions savings from materials saved from landfilling and emissions avoided in producing and transporting new raw materials. Over the next three years, WISP synergies are expected to generate 64,500 metric tons in CO2 equivalent savings.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Dar es Salaam - First Bus Rapid Transit System in Eastern Africa
#################################################################################

            September 2017        Dar es Salaam is making a shift towards faster, cleaner, and more reliable urban transportation with a new BRT system.Dar es Salaam is one of the fastest-growing urban centers in the region, with a population growth of 6.5% annually. The population is expected to reach 10 million by 2027. The large and ambitious BRT aims to provide sustainable transport solutions for this growing population and will help to avoid urban congestion and air pollution.Dar es Salaam is the first Eastern African city to implement a public bus rapid transit (BRT) project. The ambitious project, which will eventually cover 130 km and serve 90% of the population, is being phased in incrementally. Phase one has 39 trunk buses of 18 m, which can carry 160 passengers each, and 101 feeder buses of 12 m, with a capacity of 80 passengers each. When fully implemented, the BRT system will provide better, more environmentally friendly, and more efficient mobility to the city's residents. Until now, public transport, which accounts for up to 60% of all trips made daily, has been provided by more than 5,200 privately owned so-called daladala buses. The BRT line already in operation has 100% exclusive lanes and elevated terminals, and is transporting about 200,000 passengers daily. Stations and terminals bring safety and comfort not only for those who use the system, but for the entire local population, with sidewalks, cycle tracks, and a better organized public space. Funding for phase two, which will expand the network further, will commence shortly.<em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

#################################################################################

            September 2017        Los Angeles is serious about the future of electric vehicles and is installing infrastructure to create a city that facilitates the transition to EVs.Los Angeles experiences unhealthy levels of particulate pollution for the equivalent of nearly a month each year. Targeting the transportation sector provides immediate relief for LA’s most vulnerable residents on both a climate and public health level.The American West Coast city of Los Angeles is pursuing sustainability via electrification of the transportation sector as part of their Sustainable City pLAn, which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050. So far, the city has installed 1,000 publicly available chargers and is one of the most EV-friendly cities in the USA. More than half of the municipality's light-duty fleet is electric, and the city has piloted an EV car-sharing scheme to create equitable access to EVs and increase low-carbon mobility in lowand middle-income areas. This public sector investment is designed to spur private engagement and lead to a quarter of all vehicles being electric by 2035. Los Angeles has also spearheaded an unprecedented aggregation of municipal demand across the USA with its recently released Electric Vehicle Request for Information. This initiative bundled demand for EVs from several cities in order to prove the demand for EVs and drive down prices. As of March 2017, the order stood at 114,000 vehicles with a total value of $10 billion.Economic Benefits – The city is spending 35% less on maintenance for its EVs fleet compared to the fossil fuel counterparts.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Tokyo - Big Data to Promote Eco-Friendly Freight Transport
#################################################################################

            September 2017        State-of-the-art indicators will be used by the City of Tokyo to measure fuel efficiency of freight trucks, enabling the shipping industry to choose the most environmentally friendly freight companies.Tokyo plans to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% below 2000 levels by 2030, and the transport sector is set to reduce CO2 emissions by 60%. Targeting the freight transport industry will be important to reach these goals, as trucks account for approximately 40% of CO2 emissions from vehicles.The City of Tokyo seeks to reduce CO2 emissions by making freight trucks' efficiency completely transparent. Tokyo Metropolitan Government (TMG) launched the world's first fuel efficiency indicator for freight transport by collecting data from 960,000 trucks each month, analyzing more than seven million samples, and categorizing them in 60 different segments based on parameters such as type of trucks, fuel, and total weight of the vehicles. Based on the indicators, TMG evaluates CO2 reduction efforts by freight companies in a quantitative manner and encourages freight companies to make further efforts. Freight companies that can show progress will be prioritized by shippers, and their efforts will be visible on the trucks with a one to three-star rating system. In total, 264 freight companies are participating in the program, and the number of participating vehicles exceeds 10,000 trucks. As freight trucks are expensive to replace with more environmentally friendly ones, promoting a more efficient driving style is a more viable approach for many companies. If all trucks in Tokyo implemented eco-driving, an 8% reduction of CO2 emissions could be expected in the transport sector.<em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Auckland - Bike Network Given Priority in City Center
#################################################################################

            September 2017        Auckland has recognized cycling as a key component of the low-carbon approach to transforming the way we travel and is working to integrate cycling as a 'one network' solution alongside public transport.Auckland has identified transport as the first of key transformation areas, as it accounts for 39% of the city's greenhouse gas emissions. Lowering these emissions will help Auckland reach its goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 10% to 20% by 2020 and 40% by 2040.To tackle greenhouse gas emissions from transport, Auckland launched a City Centre Cycle Network program that provides a high-quality cycling experience for all Aucklanders. The city center is the most densely populated in the region and has the largest concentration of jobs: more than 230,000 people live within a 30-minute bike ride of the center, where more than 156,000 jobs are located. The city plans to build 52 km of separated cycleways by 2018. Already, after building the first seven km of cycleways, the city has experienced a steep increase of people cycling. Auckland has turned an old motorway off-ramp into a colorful new walking and cycleway. The path reached 100,000 bicycle trips just 118 days after it opened. Retrofitting the ramp signals, the city is seeing a paradigm shift from one of polluting travel to restorative travel; a clear statement of changed values. By 2020, Auckland aims for a 5% cycling mode share and by 2030, to be the 'mode of choice' alongside walking and public transport.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: London - Iconic Buses Provide Real-Time Air Quality Alerts
#################################################################################

            September 2017        Low-emission bus zones and real-time air quality updates are two ways London is cleaning up the capital's dangerous air quality.London faces dangerous air pollution levels, despite being one of the first cities to introduce maximum air pollution levels following The Great Smog of 1952.Information and awareness campaigns can go a long way towards changing people's behaviors. London is rolling out real-time updates at bus stops and via road-side messages and digital alerts to inform citizens about poor air quality. When high and very high air pollution is forecast, 2,500 bus stops will display warnings about air quality, and alerts will be sent to app users as well as to the 700,000 followers of Mayor Sadiq Khan's Twitter account. London also created low-emission bus zones to prioritize the use of the cleanest, greenest buses where they are needed most. Measurements were carried out to identify the areas of highest exposure to dangerous nitrogen dioxide, and only top-of-the-range Euro VI buses or hybrid-electric buses can use the lanes. The first of these zones was completed in January 2017 and 11 more will be completed before 2020.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Berlin - Emissions Reductions Ratchet to Climate Neutrality
#################################################################################

            September 2017        Berlin has identified 95 separate actions across six different sectors to bring the city to climate neutrality by 2050.Although Berlin has been able to reduce its CO2 emissions by a third since 1990, emissions have started to rise again since the mid-2000s. BEK aims to involve all citizens in reversing this trend.The City of Berlin has set a legally binding target of carbon neutrality by 2050. In order to achieve this ambitious target, the city developed Climate-Neutral Berlin 2050, with the Berlin Energy and Climate Protection Programme (BEK) at its center. It is the city's roadmap towards climate neutrality, in which 95 specific strategies from six different sectors are defined. The BEK is based on results of an interdisciplinary research project, as well as a broad public participation process, involving stakeholders from industry, civil society, and political organizations. The project combines actions from six different sectors: energy supply, buildings and urban development, economy, traffic, private households and consumption, and adaptation to the consequences of climate change. The specific strategies will ratchet up Berlin's emissions cuts, from 40% by 2020, 60% by 2030, and at least 85% by 2050 compared with 1990 levels. If monitoring and evaluation finds emissions trends not to be in line with these targets, adjustments are required by law.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: New Orleans - Turning Hurricane Risk into Mitigation Opportunity
#################################################################################

            September 2017        New Orleans is ready to tackle climate change head on to help reduce the frequency and intensity of climate-related extreme weather events.While many cities in the USA began implementing climate mitigation strategies 10 years ago, New Orleans was recovering from hurricane devastation. Ready to turn hurricane risk into mitigation opportunity, the city is rolling out its first community-wide strategy designed to mitigate the effects of climate change.Attack is the best form of defense for coastal cities like New Orleans that face rising sea levels and climate change-related extreme weather events. Climate Action for a Resilient New Orleans outlines 27 actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030. The strategy considers best practices in greenhouse gas mitigation such as planning to scale local solar from 40 MW to 255 MW and moving to 100% low-carbon power by 2030, a remarkable feat for a city in a state largely dependent on fossil fuels. To further reduce its contribution to climate change, New Orleans seeks to electrify the city's public transportation and ensure 50% of all trips are made using non-fossil-fuel-powered vehicles by 2030. Finally, the city currently diverts only 5% of waste from landfills, as recycling infrastructure was dismantled during Hurricane Katrina. But, with its new strategy, New Orleans plans to divert 50% of waste from landfills by 2030.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

            September 2017        Wuhan has set a goal to peak emissions ahead of Chinese targets, and has placed a strong emphasis on education and management of schools to create a generational shift in carbon emissions.Wuhan, the largest city in central China, is growing rapidly. Building sustainability into future economic growth plans is a challenge for many Chinese cities, and Wuhan is demonstrating how more ambitious strategies can be put into place.The Chinese megacity Wuhan has committed to reach its carbon emissions peak around 2022. The model-based action plan established yearly carbon emission goals by district and industry across the city, and received input from businesses and citizens during the drafting process. Schools are seen to be a key focus area for Wuhan, which has established a set of low-carbon management and education principles suited for middle and primary schools. This strategy is the first of its kind in China, and will foster awareness of a low-carbon life and society and help students understand what steps are being taken in response to climate change in their city and why. The city hopes that with teachers and students as knowledge brokers, awareness amongst the general public will increase too.<em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Toronto - Accelerating Climate Action to Reduce Emissions
#################################################################################

            September 2017        Toronto is fast-tracking climate action with its new plan, which sets the city on a sure path to 80% emissions reduction by 2050.TransformTO recognizes the acute danger of climate change and accelerates the current climate action plan to ensure carbon emissions reductions of 80% by 2050.Toronto is picking up the pace when it comes to saving the planet. Building on the success of the city's first climate action plan and aiming to accelerate action, the city's council initiated TransformTO in 2015. The renewal of the action plan recommends cross-sector targets, including 75% of energy to be renewable and 100% of transportation to use zero-carbon energy by 2050; 100% of new buildings to be near-zero emissions by 2030; and 100% of existing buildings retrofitted by 2050. Toronto seeks to not only address climate change mitigation with these goals, but equally to focus on adapting the city, making it resilient against future impacts. When implemented, these accelerated actions are projected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 857,000 metric tons by 2020. To reach the ambitious targets, Toronto has developed acceleration campaigns to mobilize low-carbon neighborhoods, prepare the city for electric mobility, and educate the workforce to construct high-performance buildings. Achieving these targets will ensure that Toronto exceeds its short-term target of 30% greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2020 and successfully set the city on a path to reach a city-wide emissions reduction target of 80% by 2050.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Johannesburg - Mainstreaming Climate Action to Lower CO2
#################################################################################

            September 2017        By introducing a new strategic framework that includes all actors in society, Johannesburg is mainstreaming climate change mitigation and setting big goals for the future.Eighty-seven percent of South Africa's energy came from fossil fuel in 2014. Instead of producing an energy-centric, short-term policy to cut emissions, South Africa has instead mainstreamed mitigation into all aspects of society, creating a more holistic approach.In 2006, Johannesburg developed its first strategy for long-term growth and development, envisioning a resilient and sustainable city. To deliver on this vision, the city has introduced the Climate Change Strategic Framework (CCSF). The purpose of the CCSF is to strengthen the city's organization in its delivery on climate change action across sectors internally in the municipality and between communities, businesses, and citizens in the city. As part of the CCSF, Johannesburg aims to mainstream climate action in the city. Measuring greenhouse gas emissions will take a bottom-up approach, with a joint effort between the municipality's departments as well as from business and communities. The city will make use of C40's modeling tool 'CURB,' which helps cities and local climate planners better understand the energy and emission implications of different low-carbon interventions in order to implement those most appropriate for Johannesburg. In doing so, Johannesburg hopes to see a unified city working towards a greener and more resilient future together.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

#################################################################################

            September 2017        Dubai has targeted both the demand and supply sides of the energy equation in a region-leading carbon abatement strategy.Dubai is situated in one of the world's leading oil-producing countries and faces challenges regarding deeply rooted, vested carbon interests. The carbon abatement strategy is a big step towards reframing the city as a sustainability pioneer.The Dubai Carbon Abatement Strategy (CAS) is a performance-based program for reducing carbon emissions up to 2021 that integrates demand reductions with increased supply of renewable energy. This strategy, costing around $4 billion in total, allows Dubai to manage its energy demand, increase energy efficiency, and develop sector-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. The high-impact sectors identified for emissions reductions in a preliminary study are power, water, manufacturing, road transportation, and waste processing. In 2015, Dubai reduced emissions equivalent to 5.7 million metric tons of CO2 and has achieved a 7.29% sectoral reduction target, of which 11% is from the power and water, 3% is from manufacturing, 6% is from road transport, and 6% is from waste. On the supply side, a planned 800 MW solar photovoltaic power plant will contribute more than 260,000 tons of CO2 equivalent emissions savings.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

            September 2017        Mexico City has financed a program that will reduce CO2 emissions and strengthen the city's capacity to withstand climate change, whilst ensuring gender equality.Mexico City's population is expected to grow to 23.5 million people by 2030. Decoupling emissions from population and GDP growth will be a significant challenge for the megacity.Mexico City's Climate Action Program is designed to maximize emissions reductions and increase resilience against future climatic shocks. The city issued $50 million worth of green bonds to finance much of the project, including investments in a new bus rapid transit lines and an LED street lighting project. This was the first example of such a financing scheme for a Latin American city, and proved popular, the bonds were oversubscribed by a factor of 2.5. The city also has an online monitoring system designed to track compliance of the program and the progress of each of its 102 climate actions. Finally, the program includes a gender perspective, which seeks to reduce inequality gaps between men and women caused by climate change effects. The city has set itself seven strategies as part of its climate action program, which include a rural and urban energy transition, containing urban sprawl, and building resilience. Each of the 16 boroughs involved has the responsibility to develop their own Borough Climate Action Program with both mitigation and adaptation actions.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

However, Oslo is in a unique position, with ready access to renewable energy and financial and human resources to develop and test new solutions, contributing to a better, greener, and more livable city.The City of Oslo aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2020 and 95% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. The strategy has three main areas: smart mobility, smart governance, and smart energy and comprises 16 initiatives such as reducing car traffic by 20%, phasing out the use of fossil fuel for heating and public transport, and eco-efficient procurement. All are intended to contribute to positive implications for climate change, urban planning and development, local transport, air quality, energy performance, eco-innovation, and sustainable employment. One of the most novel initiatives is integrating climate budgets as a part of the city's financial budget and, as such, count carbon dioxide the same way the city counts money. It was launched in 2016, and is one of the first city carbon budgets in the world. All city departments have been given responsibility for goal attainment and annual expected progress on the targets in the climate budget. The quarterly and annual reports on the progress are managed within the existing formal financial and governance system of the city.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: New York City - Modeling Aids Emissions Reductions Roadmap
#################################################################################

            September 2017        New York City has prepared a detailed roadmap to steer the city towards an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.The effects of climate change are already evident in New York City: rising sea levels; increased frequency in heavy precipitation and coastal storms; hotter days on average; and more extended heat waves. The roadmap is designed to reduce emissions from the four highest-emitting sectors.Having goals is one thing, but working out how to achieve them is another. New York City has developed a greenhouse gas emissions calculator that can tally the emissions associated with all fuel sources, waste streams, and avoided emissions throughout the city. Using this detailed and quantitative assessment, the city has calculated the necessary pace and extent of the transition to a renewable-based electric grid, renewable or high-efficiency heating and hot water in buildings, energy-efficient buildings, electric and clean fuel vehicles, and zero waste to landfills. With the emissions-cutting plans, New York City has a clear roadmap to 80 x 50, 80% reductions by 2050, and is demonstrating climate leadership via an evidence-based, comprehensive approach. To date, the city has reduced its annual greenhouse gas emissions by 14% from 2005 levels. Additionally, New York City and C40 are working to identify new measures to achieve a 9% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, followed by steeper emissions reductions of 70% by 2030 and 100% by 2050, as part of C40’s Action Plan 2020 pilot.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

            September 2017        Specific reduction targets for each energy-intensive sector will guide the City of Qingdao in achieving its emissions targets, despite experiencing rapid economic growth.Qingdao is a fast-growing city with a high proportion of manufacturing seeking to pursue further economic growth. The city's new low-carbon plan ensures that Qingdao will not be plagued by air pollution like many neighboring cities.The Qingdao Low-Carbon Development Plan, part of the second batch of Chinese low-carbon pilots, has put forward specific, systematic, and comprehensive actions and policies. The plan, running from 2014 to 2020, includes systems for spatial layout, industry, energy supply, and transportation. The plan has issued guidance for every department in the city, encouraging the local government to become low-carbon in all operations. Other Chinese cities are expected follow in Qingdao's footsteps to make low-carbon development plans.Qingdao has established a close connection between its economic development target and mitigation target over the short, medium, and long term. Before 2020, Qingdao will focus on improving energy efficiency and rationalization of industrial structure. After 2020, transport and buildings will be the key areas of carbon emissions control. Low-carbon standards in the buildings and transport sectors will be perfected in order to avoid lock-in effects that could hinder the mitigation efforts. The city seeks to cut the carbon intensity level per unit of GDP by 50% in 2020 from 2005 levels.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

#################################################################################

            September 2017        The capital of the USA is making the most of its municipal buildings by installing solar PV panels, vegetation, and cooling measures on rooftops, making the city climate resilient and reducing CO2 emissions.Washington, D.C.'s overarching adaptation strategy identified four local climate change-related challenges: extreme heat events, extreme precipitation, sea-level rise, and storm surge. The DC SmartRoof Program is designed to mitigate emissions and adapt to these challenges.In Washington, D.C., they now have more than just roofs over their heads. The DC SmartRoof Program maximizes the potential of the roofs on all public buildings to minimize and battle the effects of climate change. The city is utilizing roofs of office buildings, schools, and hospitals, totaling more than 2.6 million m2. So far, nine megawatts of solar PV have been deployed, more than 204,000 m2 of white-colored, 'cool roofs' have been constructed, and more than 37,000 m2 of vegetative roofs have been installed. The latter will be able to retain more than 360,000 liters of stormwater runoff annually, which earlier contributed to flooding caused by climate change-related extreme weather events. The program also seeks to reduce the urban heat island effect with its adapted roofs, as studies show that increasing the albedo of just under 100 m2 roof by 0.25 can offset 0.5 tons of CO2 equivalent per year, through reduced cooling demand. The nine megawatts of PV installed has further reduced CO2 emissions by approximately 5,000 metric tons in just over a year.<em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

#################################################################################

            September 2017        Kuala Lumpur is committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 20% by 2022, demonstrating strong climate leadership for the region.According to the greenhouse gas inventory, buildings account for 55% of total emissions. Public housing makes up 64% of that figure. Leveraging emissions cuts in private buildings is a considerable challenge for cities like Kuala Lumpur.Malaysia's largest and most populous city performed a carbon accounting exercise to measure quantities emitted in 2015, and is using that baseline to make further cuts through to 2022. Working with the Carbon Trust and the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the city set up five-year carbon management strategies focusing on low-cost, high-impact policies. The greenhouse gas inventory was performed in line with the World Resources Institute's globally recognized accounting methodology and calculated that emissions in 2015 totaled 120,906 metric tons of CO2 equivalent. The inventory also identified buildings, transport, and outdoor lighting as the most emitting sectors.

Cities100: Vancouver - Zero Emissions From New Buildings
#################################################################################

            September 2017        Vancouver is on the road to ensuring all new buildings contribute zero greenhouse gas emissions. A string of progressive policy actions are being put in place to require future generations of buildings to be the greenest yet.Roughly 55% of city-wide emissions are from buildings, so making improvements to building design is a top priority. Ensuring new buildings go above and beyond internationally recognized standards demonstrates global climate leadership.Vancouver has developed the most stringent building codes in North America for a cold climate city, in an effort to cut emissions in half from newly constructed buildings under seven stories high. Energy efficiency standards were set higher than LEED Gold standards by focusing on greenhouse gas emissions rather than energy consumption. These ambitious codes and regulations are part of Vancouver's Green Buildings program, which set the city on the path to eliminate emissions in new buildings by 2030. Buildings are an important area of focus for the Canadian city if it is to achieve its goal of 80% carbon emission reductions by 2050. Thanks to a large-scale hydroelectric plant, the city's electricity supply is 93% renewable, so by focusing on building highly efficient new buildings, Vancouver can make big strides towards a zero-carbon future.<em>Environmental Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Qingdao - Mining Waste Heat to Cut Smog Levels
#################################################################################

            September 2017        Qingdao is utilizing waste heat sources to reduce reliance on coal and cut air pollution. Together with ambitious energy efficiency programs and large renewable investments, the city is making strides towards meeting its low-carbon and low-air pollution goals.Qingdao's challenge of moving from a coal-based energy strategy to a more sustainable one mirrors the challenge many other Chinese cities face. Making use of waste heat from existing sources and investing in energy efficiency will help to reduce reliance on coal and bring down dangerous air pollution levels.Around 12 million people live in the coastal Chinese city of Qingdao, which has suffered from high pollution levels, like many other coal-powered cities in China. To combat this and drive investment in green growth, the city is pursuing energy efficiency and clean energy innovations on an enormous scale. Regulations covering energy efficiency standards in buildings, heating energy consumption limits, and financial incentives have all been put in place to help the city on its low-carbon transition. More than $550 million has been invested in renewable energy systems and building retrofits since 2012, more than half of which came from public funds. Combining energy efficiency with renewable investment is not a ground-breaking strategy for reducing emissions, but when it comes to heating, the city is pursuing a truly innovative approach. Qingdao is investing $3.5 billion in a clean district heating network covering 180 km2 that will make use of air, ground, and waste-source heat pumps. Waste heat from industry and the sewage system is being mined in order to reduce the requirement for polluting coal power plants.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

            September 2017        The people of Austin are blessed with abundant sunshine, and together with the municipal utility, they are committed to powering their lives using this incredible resource.Texas was the leading crude oil and natural gas-producing state in 2015In the heart of Texas, a solar revolution is unfolding. Austin, the state capital, has set a goal of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and plans to reach the target via solar commitments, innovative tariff structures, and electric storage integration. Austin's municipally-owned electric utility, in coordination with community stakeholders, aims to deploy 950 MW of solar by 2025, including 200 MW of rooftop solar, throughout the city. To meet these ambitious goals, Austin Energy is implementing a multi-prong solar strategy. Long-term procurement contracts with utility-scale solar plants will comprise the majority of the target, but to change attitudes and achieve community buy-in, Austin Energy is also developing clever tariffs to fairly spread the cost of solar and make solar accessible for all. Their first community solar project was launched in early 2017, with an 180 kW array at the Palmer Events Center. The utility also launched its own solar mapping tool, allowing residents to calculate the solar potential of their property.<em>Social Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Chicago - Energy-Saving Retrofits for Aging Housing Stock
#################################################################################

            September 2017        Chicago is pursuing energy efficiency retrofits for the city's aging housing stock. In partnership with private, public, and nonprofit stakeholders, Chicago aims to cut energy consumption by 20% over five years.Buildings are responsible for an estimated 70% of Chicago's total emissions. Driving this down is key to unlocking easy carbon savings for the city.Chicago is the third-largest city in the USA, and in an attempt to cut emissions and utility bills across multiple sectors, Mayor Rahm Emanuel introduced Retrofit Chicago, targeting residential, commercial, and municipal buildings. By bringing together expertise from multiple stakeholders in one place, the city can provide incentives and accessible energy efficiency upgrades for all. Retrofit Chicago feeds into the larger, city-wide Chicago Climate Action Plan calling for CO2 reductions of 80% by 2050. Around two-thirds of Chicago citizens live in a building 50 years of age or older, a third higher than the USA average, resulting in many power-hungry and leaky buildings. In the residential sphere, the city offers free energy assessments and expert recommendations as well as free installation of energy-saving products such as LED lights and certified water-saving showerheads. The city has also embarked on 'one of the largest municipal lighting modernization programs in the country,'replacing 85% of the inefficient high-pressure sodium public street lights with power-saving LEDs. So far, changes via this simple scheme have resulted in 173,000 tons of CO2 reductions.<em>Social Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Singapore - Solar Power on Land and Sea
#################################################################################

            September 2017        Space-constrained Singapore is looking to water as well as rooftops for solar energy as the city's population continues to grow and demand more energy.Almost all of Singapore's energy, primarily natural gas, is imported. By investing in solar PV, Singapore can reduce both its dependence on fuel imports and CO2 emissions.Singapore is one of the most densely populated cities in the world and lacks land for large-scale solar plants compared with the likes of China or Dubai. Therefore, they are now implementing Solar Nova, an accelerator program designed to aggregate demand and facilitate installation, as well as use reservoirs to host large-scale solar power projects. The city is developing floating solar panels that can be deployed on 17 available freshwater reservoirs. The first project under development will sit on the Tengeh reservoir and act as a test bed for future installations. Eight companies will have the chance to deploy panels, and after six months of performance monitoring, the two most efficient systems will be selected for additional deployments. In addition to this project, Singapore is also implementing Solar Nova, which aims to facilitate installation of 350 MW of solar across the city by 2020. In order to achieve this, there is a leasing arrangement in place where solar companies install and own the equipment and the customer pays lower utility fees each month.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

#################################################################################

            September 2017        Seattle is implementing a series of regulations, benchmarks, and codes targeting greenhouse gas emissions from the buildings sector, including an open-source platform for energy performance.Buildings are the second-largest source of carbon emissions in Seattle, primarily due to the use of natural gas for heating and cooling. Reducing building emissions is critical to meeting the city's ambitious climate goals.Seattle's recently adopted package of four NextGen efficiency programs will reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in new and existing buildings via a coordinated suite of strategies, including regulations, technical and financial assistance, and building performance data. For new buildings, the Seattle Energy Code builds upon national policy guidelines and sets the bar higher for energy efficiency standards. For existing buildings, owners are required to publicly publish energy performance figures annually, creating awareness and a competitive environment for energy efficiency in the private sector. On top of this, every five years, buildings are required to tune up energy and water operations to make further efficiency improvements. These policy tools are expected to ratchet up emissions savings in a sector notoriously difficult to impact, in order to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: San Francisco - Reporting and Incentives Cut Emissions and Bills
#################################################################################

            September 2017        San Francisco has gone above and beyond California's already rigorous buildings standards to encourage large commercial building owners to invest in energy-saving upgrades.Buildings are responsible for almost half of San Francisco’s greenhouse gas emissions. Benchmarking energy use in existing large commercial and municipal buildings, and encouraging energy efficiency retrofits, is one way to target emissions reductions in existing building stock.San Francisco aims for 100% renewable electricity by 2030 and an 80% emissions reduction by 2050. In order to achieve the latter objective, the city is targeting large municipal and privately owned buildings that consume the most energy. Expanding upon existing legislation requiring large commercial buildings to report their energy usage every year, San Francisco now requires audits that identify energyand cost-saving opportunities. A full retrocommissioning audit provides a thorough examination of the building's operations and identifies where the easiest and most effective upgrades can be made, with a helping hand from the city's cash incentives. Over four years, 468 buildings of 4.5 million m2 in the municipal portfolio cut energy use intensity by 18% and carbon emissions by more than 30%. In the private sector, audits identified energy savings worth $25 million and led to a 10% reduction in electricity usage in upgraded buildings.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Rotterdam - Strategic Transition to a Clean Heating Network
#################################################################################

            September 2017        Rotterdam is undergoing an unprecedented modern transition from individually heated houses to city-wide district heating with increased efficiencies and emissions reductions.Installing a district heating system to serve the needs of more than 900,000 people is an enormous logistical challenge for the city, but by focusing on the potential improvements in other areas, the city is turning a risk into an opportunity.In order to reduce energy consumption and replace fossil-based energy use, Rotterdam launched its Heat Transition Programme, which will optimize the balance between targeting individual building performance and city-wide clean energy policy. The city is rolling out the changes in stages, and is using the opportunity to identify other city-wide upgrades that can be achieved simultaneously, such as sewage and building maintenance. The pilot stage of the project will connect the first 1% of houses to the district heating system, and the lessons learned will be used to produce a blueprint for city-wide scale up. The goal of the heat transition is to achieve virtually zero-emission heating. The districts in transition will also be scanned for improvement opportunities such as parking problems or social cohesion. This will not only result in lower emissions, cleaner air, more jobs, and a call for innovations, but will also have a valuable and positive social and physical impact.<em>Social Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

#################################################################################

            September 2017        Washington, D.C. created a legal requirement for energy suppliers to derive half of their electricity from renewable sources by 2032.Washington, D.C. is almost entirely reliant upon imported electricity. By targeting 5% of electricity generation from local solar, and providing financial assistance for lowand middle-income earners to access solar power, the city hopes to reduce its reliance on imports.The USA's capital city passed a law requiring all energy suppliers to source 50% of their electricity from renewable energy sources by 2032, 5% of which must come from locally generated solar energy. In order to meet this target, the city must increase local solar capacity from 60 MW to 400 MW, which is expected to generate an additional 3,500 jobs in the clean energy sector. 'Solar for All' is an extension of the new act that obliges non-conforming suppliers to pay a fee, which is then used to provide the benefits of solar energy to lowand moderate-income residents of the city. These benefits must be equivalent to reducing the household's electricity bill by 50%, and can either be distributed in direct payments or by way of investment in energy storage, rooftop repair, or electrical upgrades related to development of solar projects. The Solar for All program also works with private partners to provide further benefits to low-income residents. They plan to award $13 million in grants for organizations that help low-income residents access solar technology.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

#################################################################################

            September 2017        Warsaw is upgrading its Soviet-era district heating system, improving liveability for residents and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Air pollution is a real problem in Poland, which is largely dependent on coal for its electricity. Warsaw's district heating system ensures that air quality is much better than in other cities such as Krakow where many people heat their homes by burning coal.Following Warsaw's devastation during the Second World War, a centrally planned heating system was put in place to heat the homes of the 2.6 million inhabitants. It is the largest district heating system in Europe, and in need of upgrading. Substations are used throughout the network to control the quality of heat distributed to end-users, and the Polish capital has invested more than $30 million to replace 111 group substations with 810 individual substations. These individual substations allow end-users much more control over heat levels in homes, so making the changes will improve liveability for residents as well as heat transfer efficiency and will reduce emissions. In order to complete construction during the summer before the cold weather began and minimize disruption to residents, the city distributed 30,000 information leaflets and held meetings with residents and building managers. The system covers 56% of the city, but with new substations allowing more connections, it could be expanded significantly.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

#################################################################################

            September 2017        Copenhagen is digitizing energy and water consumption data from municipal buildings to bring about significant savings and plan strategic efficiency upgrades.Seventy-six percent of the water pipelines in Copenhagen are more than 60 years old, and 11% are more than 100 years old. With aging infrastructure comes a higher risk of leakage, so having a smart surveillance network can yield energy, water, and utility bill savings for residents.The municipality of Copenhagen is working with utility companies to establish extensive energy and water surveillance systems in all municipal buildings, providing data that can be studied and analyzed on one central platform. Using high-resolution data from smart electricity, heat, and water meters, the city can identify leaks in real time and plan strategic upgrades to inefficient buildings. The scheme, which has a payback time of just six years, is unique in that it combines information from many building management systems on one platform. In 2016, the surveillance system helped to save 6,500 MWh of heat and 1,345 MWh of electricity. The city plans to extend the scheme to some of the largest privately owned buildings in the capital, helping to further bring down energy consumption. This is part of the city-wide climate strategy that has put Copenhagen on the road to CO2 neutrality by 2025.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

            September 2017        With an emphasis on educating and inspiring residents, Durban has created a framework enabling solar technology to flourish amongst its citizens.Ninety-three percent of South Africa's primary energy consumption came from coal and oil in 2014. Establishing renewables in the energy mix will require an intelligent combination of national strategies as well as educational campaigns such as Durban's calling individuals to action.Durban has created an evidence-based solar framework to promote the uptake of solar technologies in residential and commercial properties, stimulate local industry, and promote information sharing among municipalities to encourage further solar development. In a learning-by-doing approach, the city has installed 300 kW of PV on five municipal buildings. The lessons learned from these initial projects will feed into future policy developments and installations as the city adds to its solar portfolio on the 2,000 available municipal buildings. In order to encourage solar uptake more widely, the city created the first African PV mapping tool, enabling residents and businesses to calculate the PV potential of their roof, estimate savings, payback time, and find a local installer. Additionally, they are developing an online short course about renewable energy as well as an educational website for people to learn more about the potential of solar technology.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Targeting the most vulnerable is one of several ways to realize CO2 reductions in an inclusive and economic manner.The majority of Londoners rely on individual gas boilers for hot water and warm homes. However, as with many aging cities, much of the existing housing stock and heating systems are inefficient and expensive. The London Boiler Cashback Scheme and Better Boilers are two schemes designed to replace aging boilers, reduce fuel poverty, and improve air quality in London. The Cashback Scheme provided around 4,000 homeowners and private landlords with $500 cashback to replace boilers operating at less than 70% efficiency with new boilers operating at more than 90% efficiency and outfitted with better controls. The scheme used mayoral funds at the outset to leverage a further $13 million from the private sector to create deeper CO2 reductions and help achieve the mayor's target of becoming a zero-carbon city by 2050. The Better Boilers scheme specifically targets the most vulnerable communities in London and is in response to rising numbers of fuel-poor citizens in the capital.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Mexico City - Hospitals Lead the Way in Energy Transition
#################################################################################

            September 2017        Hospitals and other public buildings in Mexico City are being outfitted with energy efficiency upgrades and renewable energy systems to cut bills and carbon emissions.Providence's building stock accounts for more than two-thirds of their carbon emissions. Leading by example and installing energy efficiency upgrades in municipal buildings will pave the way for broader policy change and help achieve the goal of becoming a carbon neutral city by 2050.Mexico City is pursuing a dual-action strategy as part of their low-carbon energy transition, using energy efficiency improvements in combination with investment in renewable energy systems for public buildings. Building on the UN's Energy Efficiency Accelerator Platform, the city is performing energy diagnostics on public buildings in order to plan strategic upgrades and reduce energy consumption. As well as these 'invisible' actions, the city is also investing in solar thermal heating systems to provide hot water in all public hospitals. Mexico City already has an ambitious Climate Action Program calling for a 30% reduction in CO2 by 2020, but reducing emissions from existing, inefficient buildings is notoriously difficult. When done right, however, efficiency upgrades can be one of the cheapest ways to reduce emissions, as the pilot project at La Villa Pediatric Hospital demonstrates. After the installation of 32 rooftop solar thermal collectors, the hospital now saves around $8,800 per year in heating costs and 52 tons of CO2 equivalent.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

#################################################################################

            September 2017        San Francisco explicitly linked climate change with adverse public health effects and created an adaptation framework to better prepare citizens for the consequences of a changing climate.Global climate change has local impacts. For San Francisco, these include extreme heat days, sea-level rise and storms, and severe droughts, all of which can cause fatalities. San Francisco's Climate and Health Adaptation Framework explicitly addresses these risks.The San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) has released a framework describing the connection between climate change and local health impacts. It represents a comprehensive approach to engage stakeholders in designing solutions that reduce health disparities and climate health impacts. The SFDPH's framework assesses climate trends, defines disease burden, develops specific intervention methods, and evaluates the effects of change for communities at greatest risk. Some of the suggested city-led strategies include the deployment of a sensor network to provide real-time monitoring of air quality and weather-related warnings for vulnerable populations. To continuously address the projected health impacts of climate change, the city will develop emergency plans, create educational material for adaptation and resilience efforts, strengthen cross-collaboration between government agencies, and support vulnerable communities in capacity building.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Wuhan - Rehabilitated River Embankment Becomes Beach Park
#################################################################################

            September 2017        Wuhan has re-embraced nature to make its city safe from flooding, while also providing the world's largest beach park for the city's nine million citizens to enjoy.In 2016, Wuhan experienced its worst rain in 18 years, reaching up to 1,087.2 mm in some districts, affecting 1.7 million people and causing almost $4 billion in damagesThe Chinese megacity Wuhan is rehabilitating the embankment of the Yangtze River, as El Niño and monsoon rains have broken all records in recent years and exposed the city's inadequate flood defences. Historically, giant dikes lined the river banks, protecting riverside neighborhoods, but during extreme summer rainfall these systems failed. The city is now dismantling old defenses and instead embracing the natural protection qualities of vegetation. By modifying the embankment with a gentle slope, the area has now become the Yangtze River Beach Park. The newly established Beach Park is more than 7 km long and contains a vegetation buffer strip, 700,000 m2 of green park area, including 45,000 trees and rain gardens, which naturally filter polluted runoff water and defend Wuhan from intense storm events. Social perks add further value to the development. Fifteen kilometers of non-motorized roads, seven swimming pools, and 15 football courts cater to the 3.2 million people who have visited the park so far. A part of China's 13th Five Year Plan, the park is to become the largest urban riverfront park in the world at 10 million m2.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Quito - Prioritizing Nature for a Climate-Adapted, Low-Carbon City
#################################################################################

            September 2017        By recognizing the value of the city's ecosystems and protecting them in municipal planning, Quito is setting the standard for low-carbon, climate-adapted urban and rural development.More than 56% of Quito's natural vegetation is deemed vulnerable to climatic changes, including temperature and precipitation changes. With a population of 2.5 million, which is expected to double by 2025More than 60% of Quito's high-altitude territory is covered by vegetation. Yet, as changes in climate come into contact with economic and agricultural developments, ecosystems are being put under increasing pressure. The Ecuadorian mountain capital has therefore initiated efforts to guarantee sustainable city development focused on the city's fragile ecosystems. Quito manages the city's natural surroundings and forests as an integral part of its municipal planning and development, pursuing collaborative environmental governance between multiple city actors to enable sustainable land management from all sectors. The city has used geographic information systems (GIS) to map the baseline ecosystem data, estimate future deforestation rates, and prioritize adaptation measures in the most vulnerable ecosystems to ensure continued ecosystem services and natural resilience. Quito has recognized the importance of forest conservation for preservation of water services, including flood protection and freshwater supply, and has ring-fenced 175,000 hectares of land for protection under its 'Municipal Protected Areas' scheme. The city is also reclaiming 60,000 hectares of previously degraded land, which is expected to sequester around six million tons of carbon dioxide. This ultimately contributes to reducing the city's carbon footprint by 5% every year.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Hong Kong - Abandoned Quarry Converted to Resilient Neighborhood
#################################################################################

            September 2017        Hong Kong is transforming an old industrial site into a sustainable residential development, providing much-needed housing while ensuring climate resiliency and low environmental impact.In recent years, Hong Kong has experienced a housing shortage with a rapidly growing population, as well as issues with increased rainfall intensity and increased temperatures. The project aims to address the housing and climate change challenges in an integrated, multi-sectoral, and sustainable manner to develop a prosperous, livable, and attractive city.The Anderson Road Quarry in Hong Kong was once a facility supplying asphalt and concrete, but the now vacant 40-hectare site will supply housing for 25,000 people. In order to prepare the urban development for the impacts of climate change, the city is employing a wide array of adaptive and resilient approaches. One focus for the large redevelopment is sustainable water management, which will be attained by implementing a first-of-its-kind 7,200 m3 artificial stormwater attenuation lake park, a rainwater harvesting system, and a gray water reuse system. These measures avoid expensive upgrades to existing drainage systems and will save around 3,000 metric tons of CO2 annually, helping the city live up to its 65% to 75% carbon reduction goal by 2030 set in the Hong Kong Climate Action Plan. In further efforts to save energy and CO2, all streets will be lit with LEDs, saving up to 70% more energy than conventional light fittings, and buildings will have 3,700 m2 green roofs and 35 m2 solar panels.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

            September 2017        The trees of Barcelona take center stage in the city's efforts towards improving habitability and health for its growing population.With periods of drought, heat waves, and higher levels of solar radiation, Barcelona faces challenges in ensuring the health of its citizens. By managing its green infrastructure, the city is adapting to climate change while increasing livability for its citizens.Barcelona's green infrastructure, specifically its trees, will play a significant role in improving quality of life in the Mediterranean city. With the Master Plan for Barcelona's Trees 2017-2037, the city placed trees at the heart of local policies ensuring the appropriate management of Barcelona's tree heritage. Part of the planning focuses on guaranteeing that 40% of the tree species are adapted to climate change, such as being able to withstand droughts and heat. The plan aims to minimize the urban heat island effect by increasing the tree canopy from today's 5% to 30%, as shade and humidity from vegetation help cool the atmosphere and lower the temperature during the hotter months. Tree pits will be enlarged to better retain rainwater, enabling its use as groundwater resource and compensating for potential flooding issues with impermeable surfaces in the city's urban areas.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: New York City - Integrating Climate Projections in City Planning
#################################################################################

            September 2017        In New York City, climate change risks are now integrated into the city's existing planning and construction operations, ensuring city projects' resilience.New York City faces sea level rise, storm surges, heat waves, extreme hot days, and intense rain events. In order to increase resilience, the city has mainstreamed adaptation into the planning process, ensuring that climate projections inform building and infrastructure design.New York City is the first American city to institutionalize climate resiliency by establishing city-wide Climate Resiliency Design Guidelines for using forward-looking climate projections in city project designs. New York City's government departments all have previously developed their own development guidance but lacked a consistent approach for how to use climate projections. The guidelines provide a consistent methodology for engineers, architects, and planners to design facilities that are resilient to continued changes in climate across the entire lifespan of the facilities.The Climate Resiliency Design Guidelines are multi-hazard, addressing all major climate change risks identified by the New York City Panel on Climate Change. The guidelines address some of New York's most acute issues, such as how to limit the urban heat island effect, while also protecting facilities against extreme heat. By recommending flexible adaptation pathways, a way of designing facilities with coastal storm protections that are upgradable, the city will limit urban flooding from extreme precipitation. In doing so, the city is not only becoming increasingly resilient but also a more enjoyable place to live for millions of New Yorkers.<em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Jakarta - Alleviating Floods with Parks for Children
#################################################################################

            September 2017        Jakarta is constructing parks all over the city to reduce flood duration and to ensure better quality of life for the city's children.With more than 10 million inhabitants, the densely populated Jakarta struggles to keep the city safe when torrential rains hit. In an attempt to reduce flood duration and enhance quality of life, especially for children, Jakarta is constructing hundreds of parks across the capital.Indonesia's capital has committed to increase green open spaces from 10% to 30% of the city's 662 km2 by 2030 as part of the city's Climate Action Plan. Seeing public green spaces reduced almost 78% in the past 40 years in the city, while also experiencing steady population growth and regular flooding events, Jakarta needed a solution. To reach the 30% target, Jakarta has begun building parks through the Green Open Space and Child-Friendly Integrated Public Spaces program. By 2016, the city had completed 200 parks, and is set to complete 306 by the end of 2017. Increasing green infrastructure has improved the city's resilience and reduced flood duration from the former three days to just three hours per flooding event. Kalidojo, Jakarta's oldest and largest red-light district, was demolished and turned into one of the city's green, child-friendly parks, including jogging tracks and bicycle lanes, a skate park, an amphitheater, and outdoor fitness facilities. The city plans to have around 3,000 parks built, covering all high-density and vulnerable areas by 2022.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

#################################################################################

            September 2017        New York City and Copenhagen have joined forces in an international, innovative collaboration to build upon the successes of their respective resiliency projects.New York City and Copenhagen experienced extreme weather events in 2011 and 2012, respectively. New York City experienced coastal flooding, and Copenhagen battled downpours. As both coastal cities face rising sea levels and more frequent cloudbursts, they have teamed up to develop projects based on past experiences.Instead of waiting for more extreme weather to hit, New York City and Copenhagen have decided to leverage experiences from each other and share their successful climate solutions. While New York City is learning from Copenhagen's experience with cloudburst management, Copenhagen is drawing on New York City's experience with coastal flooding. For example, New York City's Cloudburst Resilience Planning Study is based on Copenhagen's approach, and seeks to use a combination of blue-green and traditional infrastructure to manage extreme rain events. This approach brings added benefits of CO2 sequestration, aesthetic improvements, and increased biodiversity. Not only does the collaboration demonstrate how to share and develop innovative adaptation projects, but it also paves the way for future climate action partnerships. The extensive engagement involved between the cities' governments, as well as their public and and private sectors, proves intercontinental collaboration can result in climate-adapted, resilient cities.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

#################################################################################

            September 2017        By mainstreaming adaptation measures and investing in green infrastructure, Yokohama is continuing on its path to becoming a climate adapted and safe city.Torrential downpours and heat waves have become more common in Yokohama in recent years. As the impacts become increasingly serious, the city has implemented adaptation measures to minimize damage and to create a safe, secure, and sustainable city.Yokohama is introducing a new climate adaptation strategy aiming to improve urban resilience and mainstream adaptation into all city policies. Within the strategy, concrete actions are proposed in response to climatic changes such as increased downpours and extreme heat events. One such action is to install more than 1,000 infiltration inlet systems by 2018, to separate stormwater and wastewater flows, improving flood response. Other actions include hazard mapping and disaster mitigation, improving infrastructure around the city's rivers and sewerage system, and issuing public reminders about heat stroke prevention. Under the policy, in efforts to conserve the city's green environment, is the Yokohama Green Tax, which collects $116 million yearly, enabling protection of rivers, waterways, forests, parks, and farmlands. Including the taxation income, the city plans to invest $433 million over the next five years to increase conserved forest areas by an extra five million m2, increase rice paddies by 1.2 million m2, and establish a public agriculture farm which will all add to the natural climate resiliency of the city.<em>Social Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

            September 2017        Washington, D.C. is taking a holistic approach to climate adaptation, addressing all potential future risks and committing to a comprehensive set of adaptive solutions.Record-breaking heat waves, flooding and heavy rains, and the Derecho storm in 2012 were some of the reminders that without action, Washington, D.C., would see disruptions to its power grid and face increasing economic challenges and worsening health issues. In efforts to adapt to the changing climate, the Climate Ready DC strategy was developed to ensure resilience, and a greener, healthier, and more livable city.Climate Ready DC is Washington, D.C.'s new climate adaptation plan. As part of a holistic planning process, the city worked with technical experts to develop local climate change projections; conduct a vulnerability and risk assessment of infrastructure, community resources, and residents; and identify adaptation actions. In total, 77 actions will address the identified risks across four sectors: utilities and transportation infrastructure; buildings and development; neighborhoods and communities; and governance. In addition to increasing resilience via the actions, the city also remains committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2032 and 80% by 2050. Four goals set by Climate Ready DC include improving transportation and infrastructure to maintain viability during periods of extreme weather; upgrading existing and designing new buildings to withstand climate change impacts; making neighborhoods safer and more prepared; and, finally, establishing the policies and evaluation procedures to ensure successful implementation of adaptation. In one of the initial steps, the city increased tree canopy cover to 38% to reduce the urban heat island effect.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Today, facing climate hazards and high urban population density, Rotterdam is using its rooftops to address its climate challenges and add value to the city.In Rotterdam, colored roofs have officially become part of the city's climate adaptation strategy. Challenges with flooding, air quality, and a lack of green space are all addressed via a multifunctional approach to the development of the roofs. And with 14.5 km2 of unused roof space above the city, the possibilities seem almost endless. Four colors represent four functions: blue roofs retain water, green roofs add biodiversity, yellow roofs produce renewable energy, and red roofs add social value. This holistic approach offers valuable cross-sector co-benefits. The city aims to create 10,000 m2 of yellow roofs, generating 1.25 MW of renewable energy, and construct another 80,000 m2 of blue roofs, which can retain 2,000 m3 of water.<em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

#################################################################################

            September 2017        By installing rainwater harvesting systems, Mexico City is reducing its drinkable water scarcity problem by making use of something it has in abundance: rain.Factors such as inaccessibility and high population density, along with water and soil pollution, result in a lack of adequate supply of drinking water for more than a million people in Mexico City. The city is solving this problem by making better use of the abundant rainwater in an equitable, sustainable, and innovative manner.In 2016, Mexico City launched the 'Aqua a tu Casa' program with the purpose of solving the drinking water scarcity problem in marginalized areas. By installing rainwater harvesting systems and water purification technologies in houses, apartments, and public buildings, 75 million liters of water have been saved since the implementation of the program. One of the main goals is to consolidate the reuse of rainwater in the city, thus avoiding overexploitation of aquifers and groundwater systems, the latter of which is already sinking up to 40 cm per year. Since its implementation, nearly 500 rainwater harvesting systems, water purification technologies, and drinking devices have been installed, benefitting 56,320 people. The program's focus goes beyond water conservation, and it has become a core part of the city's social policy, with its efforts towards gender equality. To promote empowerment of women who have suffered domestic violence, the city offers these women training in the installation and maintenance of rainwater harvesting systems.<em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Cities100: Hong Kong - Landslide Protection with Low-Impact Design
#################################################################################

            September 2017        Hong Kong is protecting residents from deadly, rain-induced landslides by strategically installing barriers and drainage tunnels.Hong Kong is a mountainous city with dense urban development built on steep man-made and natural terrain. Many of the man-made slopes were constructed 50 years ago without proper engineering, and with the city's high rainfall, landslides are common and cause extensive socio-economic damage and fatalities.The topography across Hong Kong's land area is dramatic: more than 60% of the land is steeper than 15 degrees and 30% is steeper than 30 degrees. Very high rainfall on this hilly natural and man-made terrain has resulted in frequent and disastrous landslides across the densely developed city. Quantitative risk assessments had predicted up to 2,500 landslides per year and identified high-risk zones. To mitigate these risks, the city is implementing low-impact and effective landslide protection solutions. Using remote sensing tools and GIS-based landslide modeling, the city has designed and strategically placed both flexible and rigid barriers to resist the impacts of landslides. This approach was chosen in favor of slope stabilization, which is not only costly but also requires extensive earthworks and tree felling. In addition, drainage tunnels and smart monitoring technology enable better control of groundwater in the city's slopes, one of the primary drivers of landslides.<em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Cities100 2017 showcases leading solutions to urban climate challenges in five sectors: Energy, Waste, Adaptation, Mitigation and Transportation.Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2017 publication online

Wuhan ‘new energy’ vehicle policy
#################################################################################

            June 2017        In terms of subsidies, ‘new energy’ vehicles eligible for financial support include electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicles. When a company or an individual buys a ‘new energy’ vehicle, local authorities will subsidise 1:1 per national subsidy. Local and national subsides will not exceed 60% of the sales price of this type of vehicle. If the maximum subsidy of 60,000 RMB is provided for a ‘new energy’ vehicle by the national authorities, a citizen buying a ‘new energy’ vehicle can get 120,000 RMB in subsidy.With respect to taxes and fees in Wuhan, ‘new energy’ vehicles are exempt from: vehicle and vessel use tax; toll charges for urban roads, bridges and tunnels; and vehicle purchase tax. In 2015, Wuhan’s ETC rate was 8 yuan/time (for vehicles of under five seats) and 2100 yuan for a year. ‘New energy’ vehicles are exempt from ETC，generating a saving of 2,100 ETC cost per year.At the same time, ‘new energy’ vehicles can charge for free at designated charging facilities. They are exempt from number plate restrictions when driving in the city.In addition, Wuhan mandates that new residence compounds and large public parking yards must plan for and provide charging facilities as per 20% of their total space. Wuhan also writes ‘new energy’ vehicles into government procurement. Fifty percent of new or replacement vehicles for government agencies, public security, judicial services, public transportation, and environment health must use ‘new energy’ vehicles. For ‘new energy’ logistics vehicles delivering in cities, permits are provided for travelling on specified routes within the 3rd ring road.

RE:FIT Programme cuts carbon emissions from London’s public buildings
#################################################################################

            June 2017        Aiming to achieve the Mayor’s ambitious targets to reduce London’s CO2 emissions by 60% of the 1990 levels by 2025, the Greater London Authority (GLA) has set a challenge to design and deliver a number of retrofitting schemes that would form the vehicle for Londoners to participate and contribute to that goal.Public buildings are a significant contributor to London’s carbon emissions – making up as much as 10 per cent of London’s total carbon footprint. The focus on retrofitting these buildings is therefore very important, especially given that 80 per cent of the buildings currently in use today will still be in use in 2050.The RE:FIT programme is the cornerstone of London’s public building retrofit activity. The programme is being delivered by the Greater London Authority (GLA) and promoted by the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40). It is the first project to be delivered in partnership with C40.RE:FIT is an innovative scheme to provide a commercial model for public bodies to implement energy efficiency and building integrated improvements to their buildings, reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions whilst accruing substantial financial savings. This is achieved by appointing an energy service company (ESCo) to undertake energy efficiency works in buildings.The ESCo guarantees a set level of energy savings, which offers a financial saving over the period of the arrangement. The risk associated with the delivery of energy savings is passed onto the ESCo rather than the owner of the building. This is known as Energy Performance Contracting (EPC). The programme streamlines the procurement process by providing pre-negotiated, EU-regulation compliant framework contracts through which a group of prequalified ESCo can undertake the design and implementation of energy-conservation measures. This standard contractual model makes it easier for public sector buyers and also reduces supplier bidding costs and time, therefore driving down costs for both parties. Unlike traditional public building improvement programmes, groups of buildings can be considered for retrofitting together, enabling greater energy and carbon savings and allowing ESCos to achieve economies of scale.To test and demonstrate the concept, pilot projects were delivered on 42 public sector buildings across London, including Transport for London, Metropolitan Police Service, and the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority. These projects retrofitted energy-saving measures to approximately 146,000 m2 of building space, delivering over 7,000 tonnes reduction in carbon emissions and an average 28 per cent reduction in energy consumption. The total spent was £7 million with a payback period of seven years.Following the success of the pilot, an OJEU compliant framework was established in 2010 for 3 years and a second framework in 2012 for a further 4 years. Building on the experience from the pilot projects and previous frameworks the GLA has procured a third one in 2016 which will drive the RE:FIT programme until 2020.A diverse selection of projects in terms of size, sector, and budget can be encompassed into the RE:FIT programme including solar PV and street lighting.  The current RE:FIT framework has 16 pre-qualified suppliers so as to assure that they will have the right experience and the optimum up to date technology in energy conservation measures and renewables to suit each diverse project.Under RE:FIT there is no sharing of any of the guaranteed energy savings and energy generated, unlike other schemes within the market, meaning all achieved efficiencies are kept by the client. The entire process is supported throughout by the RE:FIT Programme Delivery Unit.RE:FIT’s highly skilled and experienced Programme Delivery Unit (PDU) provide free-of-charge support to public sector organisations, to help them get energy efficiency retrofit projects and programmes up, running and successfully implemented.These organisations include London boroughs, NHS bodies, central government departments, higher education, schools and other educational establishments and cultural and heritage organisations.The PDU also provide a range of best practice information, including case studies, access to previous RE:FIT participants to share knowledge, benchmarking and cost information on project costs, savings and carbon reductions.The RE:FIT London Programme is able to meet most organisation’s requirements; organisations requiring high valued projects are able to go out to tender using the framework of 16, OJEU compliant specialist service providers. Alternatively, organisations whose projects are valued at a lesser amounts such as schools, are able to use a specialist service provider, already procured and therefore removing the tendering process. The PDU is jointly funded by the GLA and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).In March 2016 the GLA, following a successful 4.5 year initial appointment, appointed Turner & Townsend to act as the PDU to achieve the deliverables of the programme in London for an additional 3.5 year period up to August 2019.More than 200 London public sector organisations are participating in RE:FIT. These include 31 of the 33 London Boroughs, 31 NHS organisations and over 140 other organisations, such as central government, museums and education organisations. The RE:FIT programme has so far supported for retrofitting over 660 of London’s public sector buildings, generating estimated CO2 savings of 32,000 tonnes per annum from an investment of £102 million. The GLA is aiming to retrofit an additional 450 buildings and generate savings of 90 GWh by 2020. The carbon saved so far through RE:FIT projects is equivalent to the typical annual CO2 emissions of approximately 40,000 homes in UK.RE:FIT continues to enhance its geographical coverage and the service it provides. Since 2014 Local Partnerships have expanded RE:FIT across England and Wales, supported by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS), and the GLA has advised the Scottish government on developing an energy saving offer for buildings, while the new RE:FIT framework can include renewables and non-building assets.Sylvia Baron, Programme Director, Greater London AuthorityEmail: Sylvia.Baron@london.gov.ukTel: +44 20 7983 4239Glen Mackenzie, Director, Programme Delivery Unit, Turner & TownsendEmail: glenn.mackenzie@turntown.co.ukTel: +44 20 7544 4000

Masterplan 100% Klimaschutz
#################################################################################

            May 2017        In 1992, the City of Heidelberg developed a municipal climate protection concept. Emissions from stationary energy appliances and transport were surveyed. Administration, researchers, citizens and other stakeholders worked out a catalogue of climate protection measures. The City Administration started to improve the energy efficiency of multiple municipal buildings and participated in national and international networks. This long-lasting commitment has been reinforced by a decision of the City Council to apply for the project “Masterplan 100% Klimaschutz”, funded by the Federal Ministry for the Environment. This project aims at reducing the citywide COThe application for the “Masterplan 100 % Klimaschutz” was successful and in 2012 the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (IFEU) Heidelberg analysed the energy consumption and conducted an extensive COParallel to this scientific analysis and consultation, several events gave the citizens the possibility of bringing forward their own ideas for the energy transition in Heidelberg. Two youth climate summits opened the discussion for those who will be most affected by climate change. This whole process highlighted in the adoption of the “Masterplan 100% Klimaschutz” by the Local Council in 2014.There are seven packages of measures that form the framework of the overall process:The Masterplan started in 2014, multiple projects have already been completed and the City of Heidelberg is on the right track, as confirmed by the updated COStill it is important that the “Masterplan 100% Klimaschutz” remains a living project until 2050. It will always have to adapt to external developments, which the administration and citizens of Heidelberg cannot influence. Experience may show that some actions are more efficient than others. The year 2050 may look far away but the urban society has to take the right decisions now. It will always be important to promote the project and its goals to push it forward. The municipal administration has to form the right set-up and lead by example. However, the efforts of the citizens of Heidelberg in their personal lives and in their jobs will have the biggest effect on reaching the established goals.

            May 2017        Shanghai Chengyang New Energy Co., Ltd Fengxian Park 4.8MW Distributed Roof Solar Photovoltaic Power Station is the first distributed solar photovoltaic power station to be fully connected to the grid in Shanghai with the investment of Complete Group, a subsidiary of SFECO under SCG. Under the construction and operation of Complete Plant Import and Export Corporation it has produced 4.85 million kWh of power after a year-long operation, producing power 5% higher than expected, saving standard coal 1600t per year and reducing CO2 by 4100t. China, the second largest country when it comes to energy import and consumption has become a global manufacturer of solar photovoltaic technology and products thanks to decisions made to develop these areas. The problem of photovoltaic lighting in remote areas such as Tibet and Inner Mongolia have been worked on since 2008, and resolved. The Complete Plant Import and Export Corporation has won recognition for successfully promoting solar photovoltaic technologies and products locally. The corporation, working with Shanghai Solar Photovoltaic Technology Center, also successfully provided a complete solar photovoltaic technology production line for a Finnish photovoltaic manufacturer.The first distributed solar photovoltaic power station to be fully connected to the power grid as part of the “12th Five-year Plan” in Shanghai, this is also the first project of the Shanghai Complete Plant Import and Export Corporation to reflect the current changing times, accelerating change in the new energy trade and developing real business in solar photovoltaic power stations. In order to ensure complete safety in the process of construction, the whole development, construction and operations team started from scratch by undergoing systematic learning and special training in construction, construction process and quality, as well as in project risk control for solar photovoltaic power stations. Based on this, and with improved management systems and refined supervision techniques, we conducted a field investigation into suppliers of solar transformer components, strengthened supervision of the equipment production process, and focused on the quality of the project, equipment and installation. It took only three months to complete the laying of rooftop solar panels over more than 70,000 square metres. As the solar photovoltaic power station goes into operation, with the project team still involved, a comprehensive set of solar photovoltaic power station management rules and regulations has been developed. Currently, Shanghai Complete Plant Import and Export Corporation, which is active in ‘cooperation expansion’, has agreed to cooperate with Bright Group on a new quality distributed solar photovoltaic power station. It has reached agreement on implementing PV transit trade and domestic trade through Shanghai Complete Group and Complete Singapore Company by cooperating with GCL Group, which is ranked second in the Global Top 500 new energy enterprises. This has opened up a good opportunity for speeding up expansion of energy saving and environmental protection sectors in Shanghai during the “13th Five-year Plan”.

City Adviser Case Study Series: Shenzhen- Low-Emission-Vehicle Promotion
#################################################################################

            November 2016        SummaryBy the end of 2015, Shenzhen has achieved the goal to have more than 25 thousand vehicles in total (20,000 increase in year 2015), including 7000 LEV buses (4000 increase in 2015), which accounts for more than 50% of the overall bus fleet; the number of pure electric taxi has reached over 3000 (2500 increase in year 2015), which accounts for more than 20% of the total taxi fleet. LEV number for municipal fleet including logistics, sanitation vehicles reached 3500 or more, adding 1000 more in 2015; new purchase of LEV by private owners reached over 9000 in total. Over year 2014-2015, Shenzhen has built 1968 fast charging piles and 20,250 slow charging piles, to meet the needs of a 20-thousand-LEV-market.By the end of March 2014, Shenzhen has reached its 6,896 LEV promotion goal, saved 44,011 tons of diesel and 14,238 tons of gasoline; reduced GHG emissions of 200,796 tons including 195,205 tons of reduction from LEV buses; 804 tons from municipal fleet and 4787 tons from private cars.In year 2015, Shenzhen has weeded out 16 thousand vehicles with excessive emissions, saved standard fuel for 84,000 tons and reduced 150,000tons GHG emissions. The LEV subsidies come from both state and local government. State subsidies are mainly for LEV purchasing subsidies, but local financial subsidies vary in different provinces and cities.For Shenzhen, state level funding will be distributed to local LEV manufactory and battery leasing enterprises to cut price and thus supporting LEV purchasing project. Subsidized LEV models must be included in the “Recommended LEV Model Directory” for public notice. Subsidy standards for each model were based on the power consumption of installed battery pack; all LEV models in the “Directory” are entitled for 3,000 CNY per kwh subsidies plus 50,000CNY for purchasing one PHEV (Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle) or 60,000CNY for Blade Electric Vehicles (BEV).In terms of local subsidies, Shenzhen has set up funds mainly to promote LEV purchasing, operations, relevant research projects as well as projects on battery pack recycling. Funding would be distributed directly to relevant organizations and producers in following ways:LEV purchasing and operations (buses, taxis and municipal vehicles); LEV financing with low or even negative interest rate; research fund and project fund for LEV promotion and battery recycle. Incentive policies for promoting buses, taxies and private cars are different:Bus companies would only bear 65% of the total cost (the cost for one LEV bus is between 2-2.1million CNY) and government would cover the rest of the cost by offering subsidies.The cost of one BYD taxi was around 180,000 CNY after state subsidies of 60,000 CNY and local subsidies of 120,000CNY, which is twice higher than an average taxi. That being the case, a temporary subsidy for 10,000 CNY for each taxi was issued in year 2013. For taxi drivers, however, the biggest incentive was the policy that waives the annual license fee of 45,000 for each taxi.In addition to direct subsidies from state and local government that reduces the purchasing rate, electronic cars buyers are also entitled to gain a free immediate car title. For average cars purchasing, buyers usually need to wait years to gain car title, and the market price for one title was around 30,000 thousand in year 2015.Considering the high cost, Shenzhen has managed to integrate multi-parties to reduce the overall cost burden and market risks. The mechanism was especially effective in promoting LEV buses, building supporting facilities and ensuring maintenance services. Key words for LEV bus promotion strategies are: financial leasing; separating buses and batteries production; outsourcing maintenance and operating services. <u>Financial leasing</u>Financial firms, bus companies, bus producers, facilities and maintenance suppliers were agreed to sign financial leasing and sale-leaseback contracts. In the contract, both buses and charging facilities were set as assets for leasing.<u>Separating electronic buses and battery production</u>In LEV bus purchase, bus companies do not need to bear the overall bus cost including cost of buses and the cost of battery packs. Charging and maintenance suppliers will cover the costs for battery packs. <u>Outsourcing maintenance and operating services</u>Shenzhen bus companies have outsourced their charging and maintenance services to suppliers with battery recycling, charging, maintenance and charging station operating experience. This is to cut cost and also to share the management risk.<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA4NDEgNDE5IiB3aWR0aD0iODQxIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjQxOSIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkY4ODVfU2hlbl9DQV9jYXNlX3N0dWR5Lm9yaWdpbmFsLnBuZyUzRjE0Nzk5MTc5MDEiIGRhdGEtdz0iODQxIiBkYXRhLWg9IjQxOSIgZGF0YS1iaXA9IiI+PC9zdmc+"/>The pattern was set to solve three main dilemmas when promoting electronic buses:1.the high cost to purchase both the buses and battery packs;2.uncertain terms of reference between battery and maintenance suppliers;3.inadequate supply of charging facilities.<a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>

A sector based approach allows cities to:Using a portfolio of advocacy, policy, programs, education and awareness campaigns and recognition is particularly important when policies at other levels of government do not support action on climate change. Sydney’s sector sustainability plans are a framework for collaboration with the aim to catalyse uptake of climate change solutions and behaviour change.City of Sydney’s Sustainable Sydney 2030 vision sets bold targets including a 70% emissions reduction for the local government area (from a 2006 baseline) and more recently committed to net zero emission by 2050. Sydney understands the totality of its emissions and how to reduce them, with City of Sydney’s Master Plans on energy efficiency, renewables and advanced waste treatment solutions. But, delivering these deep emissions cuts requires detailed understanding of opportunities for reduction and barriers to action in business and community sectors. With the help of the C40 City Advisor, the city developed concrete Sector Sustainability Plans, by engaging stakeholders on emissions reduction opportunities and associated economic and social benefits to understand the impact, drivers and barriers in each sector (e.g. apartments, office, hotels, retail etc). The Sector Sustainability Plans aim to evolve the City’s approach that will incentivise the entire sectors to improve environmental performance, not only early adopters in each sector. Building sectors were prioritised because, similar to many cities, buildings contribute 80% of Sydney’s emissions. More specifically the city’s customers or stakeholders who have decision making control or capacity to affect change in these buildings were the focus. Targeted stakeholder engagement was conducted to understand what drives each sector to act on environmental opportunities and to create a sense of collective ownership of the City’s vision and the sector plans. The aim was to motivate stakeholders to act to expedite progress and deliver reductions more quickly and efficiently than would otherwise be possible by the City alone.Key outcomes from Sydney’s sector sustainability planning process include:Benefits from implementation will include:The plans also establish a framework for ongoing monitoring of progress and reductions using the Environmental Sustainability Platform. This enables review and adaptation of the plans over time, to ensure activity is focused where it is needed.The City considered various ways to segment buildings for the prioritization of the Sector Sustainability Pplans. It was important for the sectors to align with the city’s existing targets and policies where possible leveraging existing service offerings for residents, business owners and visitors or ‘infrastructure’ systems such as transport, traffic, waste management.The follow sectors were prioritized:1) Residential Apartments (the first of the sector plan adopted by council in 2015, prior to CA)2) Accommodation and entertainment3) Commercial office – listed and unlisted property groups and trusts4) Commercial office – private and small scale owners, and5) Retail.The Sector Plans target the owners and users/occupants of residential and commercial buildings based on the stakeholder affinity and common barriers to sustainability, degree of control to make change, networks for engagement and influence and consistent regulatory and governance frameworks.The sector plans needed to consider available data, decision making control of various stakeholder audiences when determining the most effective way to define sectors for targeted emissions reduction. This involved significant collaboration on the development of the Environmental Sustainability Platform.  Key steps included:<strong>Established support </strong><strong>Scoped the sectors</strong><strong>Prioritised the sectors</strong><strong>Consulted internally</strong><strong>Consulted externally</strong><strong>Scoped international cities</strong><strong>Commissioned emissions modelling </strong><strong>Developed action plans </strong><strong>Supported the City’s business case analysis</strong>Each plan aims to be a platform for collaboration, putting forward a vision or outcome that resonates with key stakeholders. Each plan outlines why this outcome is important, the barriers and challenges to achieving this vision, solutions to these challenges, what key audiences ought to act on and how the City will support action, track progress and reward success.The City will have a sector plan/position and detailed GHG emissions modelling for four priority sectors:The C40 City Advisor also supported the City of Sydney in the implementation of the Residential Apartments Sustainability Plan adopted by Council in August 2015. Key actions include the Residential Apartments Retrofit Program and advocacy to the New South Wales state government to increase the minimum environmental standards for new developments and introduce a benchmarking tool for residential apartment buildings. The accommodation & entertainment and commercial office sectors are also well placed to achieve expedient cost effective emissions reductions – the sectors were prioritized for their:Simply working with the sector with the highest impact may have burnt precious political and financial capital on a sector that has little opportunity and/or a lack of engagement and governance to take action.A collaborative effort to deliver actions in the Sector Sustainability Plans has the potential to deliver the following outcomes in each of the priority sectors.The draft five-year plan works towards 2030 target of 50% reduction in sector emissions and net zero by 2050. This assumes 50% renewable energy supply by 2030 and implementation and energy supply trends continue gaining 100% renewable supply by 2050.By 2022, the sector plan aims to reduce sector greenhouse gas emissions by 28% from 2006 levels or 155 thousand tonnes of CO2e.With BAU conditions in the greenhouse intensity of electricity supply, emissions reduction from the sector fall to 12% by 2022, 23% by 2030 and 48% by 2050, relative to 2006, a 2.5% reduction in the City’s local government area emissions in 2014-15.The measures (not including renewable energy supply) would generate a net economic benefit of almost $32 million from 2017 to 2030, this builds to just over $100 million over the economic life of measures and does not count new revenue or jobs creation.The draft five-year plan works towards 2030 target of 65% reduction in sector emissions and net zero by 2050. This assumes 50% renewable energy supply by 2030 and implementation and energy supply trends continue gaining 100% renewable supply by 2050.By 2022, the sector plan aims to reduce sector greenhouse gas emissions by 35 per cent from 2006 levels or 723 thousand tonnes of CO2e.With BAU conditions in the greenhouse intensity of electricity supply, emissions reduction from the sector fall to 19% by 2022, 38% by 2030 and 84% by 2050, relative to 2006, a 12.6% reduction in the City’s local government area emissions in 2014-15.The measures (not including renewable energy supply) would generate a net economic benefit of just over $200 million from 2017 to 2030, this builds to just over $570 million over the economic life of measures and does not count new revenue or jobs creation.Maximum emissions reduction potential in the retail sector is 28% of sector emissions over the 2006–2030 periodWith 50% renewable electricity by 2030, measures are bolstered to a 53% reduction in emissions by 2030 relative to 2006, approaching net zero by 2050.The Sector Sustainability Plans are likely to be supported by City executive, approved by council and implemented by the sector and key internal business units, thanks to extensive stakeholder engagement carried out during the development process.Working in line with the City’s governance protocols and community consultation processes, stakeholder engagement was planned early, targeted to each sector and included four fundamental stakeholder audiences:The purpose of engaging these stakeholder groups throughout the development process was to:The sector plans provide a framework for collaboration on priority issues. To engage stakeholders across the sectors efficiently and effectively the CA established two stakeholder groups and sector specific engagement plans.The internal stakeholder Project Control Group (PCG) –represented the interests of the internal stakeholders and delivery teams. Internal stakeholders appointed to the PCG met regularly to ensure: formal interaction between business units, delivery of outcomes; effective management of project risks; and collaboration on major decisions. The PCG will be accountable and responsible for the delivery of relevant operational action/s arising from the development of the sector plans.The External Stakeholder Reference Group consisted of key government agencies with a specific interest in environment and planning of the built environment; organisations representing key stakeholders and special interest groups; and energy and water distribution networks. The role of these key technical and policy experts was to: provide advice; build a common understanding of the issues, barriers and opportunities; advocate for the solutions and resources required; and support the delivery of action/s determined by the Sector Sustainability Plans.Engagement plans were also developed to deliver targeted engagement activities with sector specific stakeholders. Each sector engagement plan outlined the specific stakeholders to be engaged, what the City wanted to know or understand better; and how the City planned to establish these insights (e.g. surveys, workshops and research).Contact C40 to request a more detailed version of this case study.

City Adviser Case Study Series: Vancouver- Industry Association Partnership to Deliver Rental Apartment Energy Retrofit Program
#################################################################################

            November 2016        With 80% of its 5,000 rental apartment buildings constructed prior to 1970, and little retrofit activity among landlords, the City of Vancouver was looking for an effective approach to help landlords make energy efficiency upgrades to their buildings. Poor uptake of utility company incentives and reluctance to engage directly with the City led to the formation of a partnership with a local association of rental building owners and managers – LandlordBC – to take a multi-faceted approach energy retrofits of rental apartment buildings. The program, called Operation Co$t Cutter, is based on the trusted advisor relationship between LandlordBC and owners, providing objective support to wade through the complexities of building retrofits through the lens of maximizing return-on-investment. The program provides:In its first year of implementation, Operation Co$t Cutter has had multiple successes. 18 buildings comprised of more than 800 units reduced 650 tCO2e of emissions resulting from a reduction in 12,500 GJ of natural gas. 69% of buildings that received an energy assessment implemented a measure, which included high efficiency space heater and hot water boilers, advanced DDC control systems, re-commissioning of heating and ventilation equipment, pipe insulation, clothes washing machines, direct installation of showerheads and faucet aerators, and high efficiency toilets. Water savings in year-one from the high efficiency water devices and toilets totaled 28 million litres. This model of assistance and the partnership with LandlordBC has now been expanded to the entire province of British Columbia by the natural gas utility company as a result of its success in Vancouver.There are many barriers to retrofits in rental buildings, most of which are factors that are not possible to address by local governments such as low energy costs, the split incentive created by the building owner paying the utility bill and the tenant controlling heat and hot water and senior government policies that restrict a landlords ability to recoup investment in their property. Operation Cost Cutter has been a success because of its ability to directly assist landlords that lack the time and expertise to sort through myriad technical solutions and service providers for an issue of secondary priority for them. Specific ways that the program was able to assist landlords and deliver outcomes include:

City Adviser Case Study Series: Addis-Ababa BRT System- Stakeholder engagement series
#################################################################################

            November 2016        Addis-Ababa’s BRT system, approved in 2011, forms part of Addis-Ababa’s 2011 Transport Policy. With walking taking up more than 60% of the city’s modal split, the BRT offers a much needed alternative to getting around the city, offering a faster, regular, more equitable and reliable transport option. The 16 km pilot corridor for Addis-Ababa’s BRT is currently in detail design phase. Expansion of the system includes a plan to launch 6 other corridors by 2030. In 2015, C40 played a key role in working with the Addis-Ababa Transport Programs Management Office (TPMO) in developing the BRT’s Public Engagement, Branding and Communications Strategy and workplan. A grant of close to 1 million Euro has since been secured to implement this comprehensive strategy and other technical functions towards the successful realization of the BRTB2 Project. Three key stakeholder engagement actions have taken place since 2015.1. Addis Ababa has held a series of stakeholder engagement meetings with affected minibus and taxi operators in various sub-cities throughout the corridor.a. Result: The city is currently working out strategic plans to offer minibus operators affected by the BRT B2 pilot project shareholder positions in the BRT’s new Sheger Express Bus Operating Company or opportunities to be incorporated in the BRT system operation (as bus drivers or other employees).2. Addis-Ababa partnered with WRI and C40 in sponsoring a high level leadership study tour to India in order to get leadership on board. Ten transport officials visited BRT systems in New Delhi, Ahmedabad, Indore and Bhopal. Delegates included heads of the Transport Programs Management Office (TPMO), Sheger Operator (BRT Operator), the Addis-Ababa Police Commission, the Addis-Ababa City Roads Authority (AACRA), the Addis-Ababa Road and Transport Bureau (AARTB), the newly established Public Freight and Transport Authority (PFTA) and Traffic Management Agency (TMA).b. Result: Delegates visited BRTs that have helped transform key Indian cities by cutting travel times, reducing traffic deaths and injuries, decreasing carbon emissions and air pollution, and improving the overall quality of life for residents. One of the delegates stated, “This program was very useful for the delegation, who are the key stakeholders in this process, and of the steering committee. They have seen BRT systems practically, and understood what the challenges could be. A topic that in the past was never been on agenda, we have just starting to discuss it, now people are taking part of the decision making process. It means that whatever decision we will make, it will be now an informed decision3. Urbanization can often result in cities and communities losing their identities. Addis-Ababa is in the process of engaging architectural design students who will work with the city’s experts in heritage, parks and urban design in a workshop which will result in the design of key station icons, public parks, station names and information bulletins along the corridor.c. Result       Developing a plan for strategic and continuous engagement with stakeholders is critical to ensure that a city know when and how to engage key stakeholders to make sure that they are aware of upcoming changes which will impact their livelihoods or daily lives so that they are able to voice their opinions at key practical stages and can therefore feel ownership of the new BRT system. Addis-Ababa has had the benefit of getting its public engagement plan peer reviewed by a number of C40 cities and learning about BRT systems from various cities around the world. Aware of possible challenges which the city might face during the planning and implementation phase, Addis-Ababa’s plan to invest in a comprehensive and well-funded public engagement plan is a concrete example of the importance of early planning to ensure participation of various stakeholders at key stages of the project’s design and implementation.

            November 2016        The fund’s GBP 102 million (USD 135 million)London aims to reduce GHG emissions by 60% below 1990 levels by 2025. To achieve this goal, the city has developed a number of strategies and programmes related to energy efficiency, energy supply, waste, low carbon economy and adaptation (e.g. RE:FITThe LGF is a JESSICA<b>Value: </b>The LGF (FEF and LEEF in particular) has managed to secure additional streams of funding from private sources at both fund level and project level. This plays a key role in supporting the sustainability of the fund. FEF secures a minimum of GBP 25 million (USD 33 million) at fund level from the private sector, including Pension Funds, and GBP 33 million (USD 44 million) at project level from other investors. LEEF secures GBP 50 million (USD 66 million) from the private sector (Royal Bank of Scotland) at fund level, and an additional GBP 284 million (USD 376 million) from other investors. The GSHF has also received GBP 200 million (USD 265 million) from the EIB in 2012 to develop energy efficient social housing. It would have been difficult to leverage additional private sector finance if a grant model had been used. Having used this structure, the fund is expected to show a significant leveraging effect (15x times the initial investment by the Greater London Authority). <b>Structure: </b>Authority and the London Waste and Recycling Board. Their main responsibilities are to hold the initial capital, any proceeds from investments, and interest earned from capital that has not been invested. The EIB is also responsible for setting up and selecting the organisations to manage the Urban Development Funds and to monitor their performances. The LGF focuses on waste management, decentralised energy and energy efficiency schemes that support the Mayor’s environmental targets, with a particular focus on reducing GHG emissions. The fund allocates funding to three Urban Development Funds, which are separate legal entities and invest directly in projects: <b>Foresight Environmental Fund</b>Launched in March 2011, FEF provides equity finance or equity-type investments for the construction or expansion of waste to energy facilities, re-use, recycling or reprocessing facilities, and other facilities displacing fossil fuels such as ‘waste to fuel’. <b>London Energy Efficiency Fund</b>Established in August 2011, LEEF mainly provides debt finance to private and public sector building retrofit projects and to decentralised energy schemes and associated distribution systems. LEEF has provided debt financing to support energy efficiency measures in 72 buildings. Equity finance is also available, subject to project financing structure. The LEEF can lend money to different parties, including public, private sector or joint venture entities such as Energy Service Companies. A condition of the loan is that the projects must involve eligible works to public sector owned or occupied buildings. Borrowers can take up to GBP 20 million (USD 26 million) with no set payback period and each project must deliver energy savings of at least 20%. <b>Greener Social Housing Fund (GSHF) </b>Since March 2013, the GSHF has been providing investments mainly in the form of loans to landlords of social housing for retrofitting works. GSHF has invested in three Registered Providers of social housing – Gallions Housing Association, The Origin and A2Dominion – to support the refurbishment of over 2,500 properties to make them more environmentally friendly. The Funds are independently managed by professional fund managers that make repayable investments in projects. They make decisions on projects in which to invest, based on the investment policy agreed by the Investment Board. The LGF has invested GBP 102 million (USD 135 million) in 18 projects so far. As of November 2014, they are predicted to save 288,805 tonnes of GHG per annum and to divert 440,980 tonnes of waste from landfill per annum, resulting in the creation of 2000 jobs, 34% energy use savings and 61 MW of energy generated. The returns will be reinvested in similar activities, generating an even higher impact. London’s approach has successfully leveraged private sector investment and supported the fund’s financial sustainability, enabling finance to be reinvested in similar activities. Cities could look to this model to secure additional funding at both the fund and project level.C40's The City Climate Funds Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

C40 Good Practice Guides: Amsterdam - Sustainability Fund and Amsterdam Climate & Energy Fund
#################################################################################

            November 2016        Amsterdam has invested in over fifty projects in the areas of climate, sustainability and air quality through two revolving funds totalling approximately EUR 30 million (USD 32 million)The <b>Value: </b><b>Structure: </b><b>1. Amsterdam Climate &amp; Energy Fund (AKEF) </b>The AKEF supplies risk finance like subordinated loans and is run by external fund managers. The AKEF was established in 2013 to supply risk finance, primarily in the form of subordinated loans. External fund managers known as ‘e3’ run AKEF, including three portfolio managers and one professional fund manager. e3 comprises three different partners – EWIC, Privium Fund Management and Libertus Energy Finance – with a track record of managing sustainable project investments. The City of Amsterdam has no influence over investment decisions, as an independent Investment Committee supervises the fund managers and must approve all investment decisions proposed by the fund managers. The Investment Committee is comprised of five experts on investments, public sector finance, and energy efficiency. The City selects two of five board members, both of whom must not be affiliated with the city government, while e3 selects the remaining three. The fund has invested EUR 25 million (USD 27 million) so far, in a range of commercial large-scale projects. Each loan typically ranges between EUR 500,000 – 5 million (USD 532,000 to 5.3 million). These investments target companies and large energy efficiency and sustainable energy production projects. AKEF provides mostly subordinated loans offering a minimum return of 8% for projects that offer reductions of at least 30 kg COExamples of the projects that AKEF has financed include the second largest solar roof in the Netherlands at the time of construction (Amsterdam Arena<b>2. Sustainability Fund </b>The Sustainability Fund provides smaller, low-risk, non-commercial loans and is managed directly by City of Amsterdam civil servants. The fund offers loans of to up to EUR 500,000 (USD 532,000) at a standard 2% interest rate. Co-financing with the private sector is incentivised by offering a 0.5% interest rate discount when 33% or more of the project financing comes from a non-governmental entity (e.g. a bank, crowd funding, own funds). The Sustainability Fund was originally part of the Amsterdam Investment Fund (AIF), established in 2011In 2015, Amsterdam formally separated out the segment of the fund set aside for social projects to create the Sustainability Fund, and terminated the original AIF. The new Sustainability fund has EUR 40 million (USD 43 million) to lend specifically to local sustainability projects that offer direct GHG reductions. The Sustainability Fund’s operations launched in January 2016, housed within the Sustainability Office of the City of Amsterdam. The fund provides loans to local projects that provide clear GHG reductions, supporting a variety of stakeholders and organizations like building owners, schools, sports clubs, theatres, and social housing corporations and small enterprises. Over 75% of loans are used for solar energy projects, but the fund has also financed aspects of heat and cold storage, insulation, and energy efficient furnace projects. Companies seeking to finance projects can also receive loans, but, for regulatory reasons, they cannot use money for “commercial investments” that improve their competitive position. This stipulation has the added benefit of minimizing the risk that the loan is not repaid. In addition to energy saving and production projects, the fund is experimenting with loans for advancing the circular economy. As these projects are typically the core business of relevant companies, the aforementioned competition stipulation makes it harder to fund circular economy projects. Initially, the Sustainability Fund received a low number of applications for loans. In response, the fund created a program to provide potential applicants from targeted sectors free energy audits (‘energy scans’). The city pays for independent energy advisors to assess prospective projects, estimating a building owner’s potential to save on energy costs or generate renewable energy. The advisors also help owners assess investment options by getting quotes from suppliers and assisting with loan applications. These energy auditors are, by design, not in the business of installing solar to prevent conflicts of interest and build confidence among potential applicants. To date, this approach has been quite successful in identifying additional projects. New projects financed as a result of these services include the installation of LED lights and solar panels and the creation of systems at a sports club to turn off freezer facilities and stadium lights when the space is not in use, among others. All projects that the fund finances must contribute to the aims of the Sustainability Agenda approved by the City Council in 2015. Projects worth between EUR 200,000-500,000 are judged according to the environmental effect per euro invested and the amount of co-investment involved, with higher levels of co-investment generating a better rating. This competitive element helps to incentivize improvement on the proposals. Projects under EUR 200,000 must only demonstrate they clear a hurdle of 1 tonne of COBorrowers must repay Sustainability Fund loans within 15 years. So far, no funded projects have failed to meet their financial obligations. The AKEF and Sustainability Fund have invested in over 65 projects in the field of climate, sustainability, and air quality totalling over EUR 30 million (USD 32 million), which translates to nearly EUR 30,000 (USD 32,000) per day.Amsterdam’s approach to a city climate fund has been particularly effective in engaging the community to make green finance available for a more diverse group of stakeholders. The city has created loan funds to finance projects that are too small to qualify for traditional financing, making energy efficiency retrofits and renewable energy projects more affordable for SME’s and individual residents. Amsterdam is also investing in projects and companies with risk profiles or returns that have less historical precedent and are therefore more expensive to finance through traditional means, like circular economy businesses and innovative renewable energy technologies. The choice to offer specialized technical assistance and free energy audits has further benefited the city by demonstrating an on-going commitment to engage with and support city stakeholders, while securing a pipeline of viable projects to fund.<b>Additional instruments </b>Although technically not part of the Sustainability Fund or AKEF, Amsterdam also maintains the Amsterdam Energy Loan. This provides low interest loans to homeowners, Homeowners Associations (HOA), and small private landlords for works such as solar panel installation, which make up 75% of the projects, insulation, and projects without a positive business case like window frame renovations. Energy loans range from EUR 5,000 to 15,000 (USD 5,300 – 16,000) per household. There is no minimum GHG savings requirement. Amsterdam has found, however, that homeowners and other groups eligible for such loans have not taken advantage of this program at the scale the city government expected. The city has noted that residents feel little urgency to take the steps to install solar or conduct energy retrofits. In response, Amsterdam is currently considering new incentives for solar deployment as well as policy instruments that will make it easier for residents and other small-scale electricity consumers to install solar panels. Finally, Amsterdam co-funded three rounds of the Rockstart Accelerator Smart Energy-program. This is an annual intensive programme lasting six months in which ten sustainable energy start-up enterprises from around the globe receive training, mentoring, legal, financial and fiscal support and the chance to pitch their ideas to investors. The companies offer 8% of their shares in return for programme participation.C40's The City Climate Funds Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

            November 2016        The Toronto Atmospheric Fund (TAF) has thus far invested CAD 60 million (USD 45 million) in low-carbon projects, supporting 152 Mt of GHG reduction opportunities, CAD 55 million (USD 41 million) in energy savings for the City of Toronto, and the incubation of several pace-setting projects that have helped achieve significant community-wide GHG reductions. TAF also attracts additional funding for various projects from governmental agencies, foundations, and private sector corporations. The City of Toronto aims to reduce its emissions by 30% by 2020 and by 80% by 2050, based on 1990 levels. The goal of the fund is to advance local solutions to climate change and air pollution by supporting community innovators and de-risking low-carbon strategies and opportunities. TAF focuses on renewable energy, energy efficiency, low-carbon transportation solutions and projects that improve air quality, using a variety of approaches to demonstrate and de-risk solutions including investment, technical trials, policy reform, and social engagement. <b>Value: </b><b>Structure: </b>TAF manages a diverse investment portfolio including bonds, equities and direct investments (loans and other instruments). In the latter category, CAD 19 million has been earmarked for financing energy efficiency retrofits. Two standing committees assist the Board of Directors: the Grants & Programs Committee recommends projects that receive investment and the Investment Committee recommends TAF’s investment policy and all investment decisions. TAF staff are responsible for fundraising to attract external resources. TAF has three core programmes: incubating climate solutions, mobilising financial capital, and mobilising social capital. <b>1. Incubating climate solutions </b>FleetWise EV300: In 2006, when there were still many questions and uncertainties regarding the use of electric vehicles, TAF worked with public and private fleets to investigate the technical and business case for electric vehicles, developing a decision support set of tools that has helped them assess the best way to integrate electric vehicles into their fleets, identify suitable models, train drivers, and track performance. LightSaversTowerWiseOther incubated projects include: Pumping Energy Savings, Solar City and TransformTO<b>2. Mobilising financial capital </b>The aim of this program is to use TAF’s innovation capacity and asset to directly invest in projects that both earn TAF a return and demonstrate and de-risk low-carbon financing and investment opportunities. PACE: TAF launched Collaboration on Home Energy Efficiency Retrofits in Ontario (CHEERIO)Efficient new construction: TAF worked with Tridel (one of the biggest developers in Toronto) on overcoming the split-incentive barriers to making improvements between developers and owners.

            November 2016        Over AUD 16.9 million (USD 12.5 million)The City of Melbourne aims to become carbon neutral by 2020, as expressed in its Zero Net Emissions by 2020 strategy. To achieve this goal, the city initiated a range of programmes supporting emissions reductions from the building sector (1200 Buildings<b>Value: </b><b>Structure: </b>The SMF Chief Executive Officer and staff are employed by the Corporate Trustee of the Sustainable Melbourne Fund (SMF Investment Management Pty Ltd), which is responsible for overseeing the fund’s performance in line with its mandate. One of the key activities of the SMF is the EUAs programme. SMF also provides additional investments, as explained below. <b>Environmental Upgrade Agreements (EUAs) </b>SMF designed and implemented the EUAs programme for the City of Melbourne. EUAs can fund any building upgrades that improve energy, water and waste performance. For example, they can fund renewable energy installations with no upfront costs and on commercially attractive terms. EUAs are available to owners, tenants, service providers and property managers. EUAs work similarly to traditional finance, where a financier provides a loan and the owner makes repayments. To be considered for an EUA, Melbourne-based building owners need to sign up to the City of Melbourne’s 1200 Buildings programme. The EUA is secured against the building, while the local council collects repayments utilising its property taxing authority (locally referred to as Council property rates and Charges) and then redistributes them back to the lender. This reduces the risk for financiers and lenders who are able to provide better terms. Additionally, this structure enables a building owner to collect tenant contributions towards the loan repayments through the existing provisions of the tenant lease agreements. This solves the commonly encountered split-incentives dilemma, whereby the costs of building improvements are borne by owners and the benefits (in terms of lower energy bills) accrue to the tenants. To ensure that the Melbourne City Council could levy the environmental upgrade charge, the City of Melbourne Act was amended in 2010. Most recently the State Government of Victoria amended the Local Government Act 1989, enabling each of Victoria’s 79 local governments to now voluntarily offer EUAs within their municipal boundaries. The programme has laid the foundation for a national EUAs marketplace – other States and territories have replicated the State legislation required for such marketplaces. SMF acts as a third party administrator for these programmes. It establishes the programme for municipal governments, operates as a point of contact and facilitates project discussions between property owners and tenants, financiers and the councils, while also providing ongoing monitoring and reporting. This approach has several advantages. Research conducted by the council has found it is the property industry’s preferred model, and is also the least costly arrangement for councils. SMF has been able to leverage its knowledge, frameworks and tools in launching the third party administrator model in other municipalities and has maintained consistency in the services provided. Including Melbourne, SMF currently provides its services to ten Local Governments within the State of Victoria, thus creating a new marketplace in the State.<b>Other types of investments </b>SMF also provides up to 100% loans in energy efficiency, water efficiency, waste minimisation and clean technology projects that deliver clear environmental benefits and contribute towards the city’s sustainability outcomes. The fund has developed a range of finance products to target different types of projects in both commercial and residential properties. For instance, SMF Solar FinanceSMF has made over AUD 16.9 million (USD 12.5 million) in direct investments in building upgrades, renewable energy systems, residential neighbourhood innovations, lighting solutions and software technology. These direct investments have resulted in over 245,000 tonnes of GHG reductions. Through reinvesting returns and facilitating co-financing from banks, SMF has supported renewable energy and energy efficiency projects worth over AUD 26 million (USD 19.2 million). Operating as a facilitator between property owners, tenants, financiers and the councils can help city climate funds create products and services that target the needs of the different parties. In the case of EUAs, the third part administrator role of SMF was cost effective for the council, and was also the industry’s preferred arrangement. C40's The City Climate Funds Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

C40 Good Practice Guides: New York City - New York City Energy Efficiency Corporation
#################################################################################

            November 2016        Established and endowed by New York City (NYC) in 2011 with USD 37.5 million of federal grant funding, the New York City Energy Efficiency Corporation (NYCEEC) has financed nearly USD 100 million of clean energy projects to date across 7.2 million square feet of NYC buildings—eliminating over 629,000 metric tonnes of greenhouse gases and resulting in the creation of over 1,000 jobs. NYCEEC’s design as a highly flexible, mission-focused specialty lender has attracted additional funding from the public sector (federal, city and state), commercial lending institutions, and philanthropy. NYCEEC provides loans and credit enhancement solutions for energy efficiency and clean energy projects that save energy and reduce greenhouse gases. NYCEEC’s mission is to innovate and deliver clean energy financing solutions for buildings, and its vision is that clean energy financing markets for buildings will develop and align with the city’s long-term environmental goals. As such, NYCEEC works closely with the City of New York to support their environmental policies<b>Value: </b><b>Structure: </b>NYCEEC’s core capital is structured as a revolving loan fund whereby NYCEEC offers a variety of debt products to building owners and project developers to finance building-scale energy efficiency and clean energy projects. NYCEEC also provides credit enhancement to encourage private lenders to offer efficiency loan products. Because NYCEEC is a revolving loan fund, the fund can recycle capital as loans are repaid. NYCEEC also levers its balance sheet to multiply impact. NYCEEC lends at market equivalent rates while offering enhanced features to property owners to facilitate efficiency investments, namely flexibility, technical guidance and terms designed to meet project investment needs. Loans and credit enhancements generate income to support NYCEEC operations. NYCEEC supplements earned revenue with philanthropic funds to bolster financial strength and support field advancing activities, such as publishing project performance results and lending best practices. NYCEEC is staffed with both financial experts and engineers specialising in building energy systems. This novel combination of professional capabilities allows NYCEEC to innovate and advance the use of creative financing tools while producing strong environmental results. NYCEEC’s strategy includes three priorities: financing projects, building partnerships, and advancing the field. <i>Financing Projects</i>As an unregulated, specialty finance company, NYCEEC operates in a highly flexible manner and has the capacity to innovate and produce creative financial solutions to meet the needs of a developing energy efficiency market. To date, NYCEEC’s financial products include pre-development loans, equipment loans (secured and unsecured), energy services agreements, power purchase agreements and green mortgages. <i>Partnerships: </i><i>Advancing the Field</i>NYCEEC has several initiatives designed to provide information and transparency to the market, to remove barriers, and to develop innovative tools. Monitoring and reporting financial and environmental results at the project level is a high priority, as is removing barriers to investment such as obstacles to lender consent, high transactions costs, and current low levels of standardisation.To date, NYCEEC’s initial USD 37.5 million capitalisation has resulted in debt financing of over USD 96 million of energy efficiency and clean energy project costs in predominantly multifamily and commercial buildings. This portfolio of projects is projected to eliminate over 629,000 metric tonnes of GHGs (over the useful life of the equipment). NYCEEC has established several lender partnerships, resulting in greater capital access for efficiency. NYCEEC focuses on building sectors in NYC with the greatest contribution to GHG emissions and the toughest challenges in mobilising energy efficiency investment – namely privately-held, larger commercial and multifamily buildings (including the affordable multifamily housing sector). NYCEEC’s approach is to finance a wide range of technologies that save money and reduce GHG emissions, ranging from simple, proven approaches to deep multi-measure retrofits. NYCEEC has been active in supporting the development of “passive house” approaches in NYC buildings by providing attractive financing to this emerging sector.Creating an independent but closely affiliated non-profit financing organisation like NYCEEC is a tool that cities can use to attract both philanthropic and private capital investment to an under-invested sector. Attracting private capital resources is critical, as there is clearly insufficient public capital to create a truly sustainable built environment. NYCEEC’s structure promotes innovation to advance investment and remove barriers. Offering financing through funds like NYCEEC provides cities a vehicle to do the “R&D” work and iteration needed to develop and test innovative approaches. NYCEEC maintains a very close working relationship with city and state policymakers, sharing lessons learned in order to shape effective policies that drive greater clean energy investment.C40's The City Climate Funds Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

City Adviser Case Study Series: City of Rio de Janeiro- Climate Change Planning Through Direct Support
#################################################################################

            November 2016        Rio de Janeiro has had a City Adviser since 2007, when the city became a member of C40 as megacity. At the first stage of the partnership, C40 supported Rio positioning climate change as a central role in the strategic planning of the city. This measure was accomplished as Rio updated the GHG inventory and elaborated a comprehensive climate action plan, which served as the basis for the Municipal Climate Change Plan, enacted as law in 2011. This placed Rio as one of the first Brazilian cities to have such a plan with objective goals for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.Since then, C40 has been working hand-in-hand with the city’s political, administrative and technical leadership to support implementing the strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and climate risk, with multiple local partners, in close collaboration with C40 networks. The areas supported by C40, identified as having the largest impact in reducing GHG emissions and climate risks are: transportation, energy efficiency, solid waste management, resilience, monitoring and land use planning. This support culminated in Rio’s achievement of becoming the first city in the world to be fully compliant with the Compact of Mayors just before COP21. The Compact is a global coalition of city leaders dedicated to reducing their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and making urban communities more resilient to climate change. Compact of Mayors commitments are analogous to the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (iNDCs) pledged by nation states. Now with the European Commission, the Compact of Mayors is part of the Global Covenant of Mayor for Climate and Energy.Although the city currently has low GHG emissions per capita, compared to other global cities, the city has been committed to further enhancing its climate action plan with the support of C40. In April 2015, Mayor Paes was the first Mayor in the world to sign the Earth Statement and joined scientists and leaders from around the world to limit global temperature rise to 2In summary, C40 has developed a partnership with Rio in all stages of municipal climate policy and projects: envisioning, elaboration, implementation, monitoring and evaluation.       Within this partnership, C40 offers a wide array of supporting tools, which includes:Over more than 8 years, C40 has supported Rio de Janeiro, through the work of a city adviser, to move forward an ambitious climate agenda. The following summary contains an overview of key projects and events:Among the factors for success in the C40 Rio de Janeiro city adviser support to the City of Rio de Janeiro are:

City Adviser Case Study Series: Mexico City- Sustainable Buildings Certification Program
#################################################################################

            November 2016        The Mexico City’s Ministry of the Environment manages the voluntary Sustainable Buildings Certification Program (1). The Program aims to foster sustainable construction and usage of commercial, industrial and residential buildings by awarding certification that reflect various levels of sustainability performance in the areas of energy efficiency, water, mobility, solid waste, social and environmental responsibility, and green roofs.Voluntary participation from building owners and tenants is incentivized through tax reductions, reduced energy and water bills, access to project financing, expedited permitting procedures, and finally, prospects of increased rental yields from green premiums.Since its creation in 2009, 40 buildings have been certified as of 2015, resulting in a total reduction of 20.1 million kWh of electricity, 205,690 mProperty and payroll taxes reduction incentives for participants in the Program are generating important economic benefits. Certification also provides reduced building operational costs due to increased energy and water efficiency performance. Certification also leads to increases in property values.Conducting physical improvements in existing and new buildings, equipment and systems, raise environmental sustainability and reduce energy consumption and maintenance costs, in addition for commercial, residential and industrial owners and tenants to qualify for property tax and payroll tax reductions.(1) Mexico City Ministry of the Environment, Sustainable Buildings Certification Program<a href="http://data.sedema.cdmx.gob.mx/sedema/index.php/tramites/programa-de-auditoria-y-autoregulacion-ambiental/edificaciones-sustentables">http://data.sedema.cdmx.gob.mx/sedema/index.php/tramites/programa-de-auditoria-y-autoregulacion-ambiental/edificaciones-sustentables</a><a href="http://martha.org.mx/una-politica-con-causa/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/15-Certificacion-Edificaciones-Sustentables.pdf">http://martha.org.mx/una-politica-con-causa/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/15-Certificacion-Edificaciones-Sustentables.pdf</a><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2ufvj8a6marezs9/Programa-Certificacion-Edificaciones-Sustentables.pdf?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/2ufvj8a6marezs9/Programa-Certificacion-Edificaciones-Sustentables.pdf?dl=0</a>

City Adviser Case Study Series: City of Melbourne - Queen Victoria Market Precinct Renewal
#################################################################################

            November 2016        Melbourne is the fastest growing capital city in Australia. It is anticipated that Melbourne’s population will effectively double from around 4.3 million currently to over 8 million by the 2050s, at which point it will overtake Sydney to become the largest Australian city. In order to accommodate this growth urban renewal will need to occur both within the City of Melbourne and across metropolitan Melbourne more broadly.The City of Melbourne is engaged in an ongoing process of planning for the growth of the city. It has been preparing the strategic framework that underpins this renewal for some time through the development of a series of structure plans and strategies on sustainability, economic development and city shaping.In October 2013, the City of Melbourne announced the largest investment in its history to renew the Queen Victoria Market, and create one of the world’s great market precincts. The site is strategically placed in the north of CBD, and provides a key civic space to deliver on the City’s strategies and aspirations for the market and the City.Currently the Queen Victoria Market precinct is not performing as well as it could with respect to sustainability. This is both in relation to mitigating the greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts associated with market operations, and also in adapting to the ongoing effects of a changing climate. For example, the precinct lacks any significant level of sustainable infrastructure, and the current open-lot customer car park is also one of the most significant contributors to the urban heat island effect in the City.Aspirations to address sustainability through the Queen Victoria Market Precinct Renewal Program (the Program) were distilled through an extensive community engagement and strategic briefing process and ultimately captured in the Queen Victoria Market Precinct Renewal (QVMPR) Master Plan, endorsed by the Melbourne City Council in July 2015The Master Plan adopts a number of sustainability goals:A Precinct Renewal Sustainability Plan (PRSP) was subsequently developed to describe the strategic pathways and key implementation actions to be undertaken throughout the Program, as well as to manage potential risks and other considerations, in order to ensure that the desired sustainability outcomes are achieved.The development of the PRSP was a key deliverable of the C40 City Advisor (CA) to Melbourne. In developing the Plan the CA was able to draw on a range of C40 initiatives, including the Low Carbon Districts Network and Climate Positive Development Program, to obtain insights from various cities into best practices and lessons learned.With respect to energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, the Queen Victoria Market currently consumes an average of approximately 2.1GWh of electricity annually and produces around 2,250 tonnes of CO2 equivalent, including emissions from non-electrical sources, such as natural gas and transport fuels.The rollout of the Program will almost certainly see energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions increase in the absence of any other action. It is estimated that, at the completion of the Program, the projected electricity consumption of QVM and City owned and/or operated assets within the renewal precinct will be around 4.4GWh annually, and that this would contribute to growth in overall total annual emissions to approximately 5,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent; more than double the current level.The PRSP describes a series of strategies and associated actions that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions to a net-zero carbon position. The key steps in the net-zero carbon pathway are to:In addition to addressing greenhouse gas emissions, the PRSP also articulates a range of strategies to achieve the remaining sustainability goals.The PRSP was endorsed by the QVMPR Program Control Group in July 2016, and will now be developed into a public facing document to outline the Program’s sustainability goals and actions. The public version of the Plan will be released in early 2017 before program implementation commences within the precinct, engaging stakeholders with the plan and the broader sustainability aspirations and actions for the precinct.In addition to the PRSP, the City of Melbourne will also measure the overall social, economic and environmental sustainability of the Precinct Renewal by achieving a certified rating under the Green Star Communities rating tool. Green Star Communities provides a framework to evaluate the social, economic and environmental sustainability attributes of the planning, design, and construction of large scale development projects, at a precinct, neighbourhood, or community scale. It evaluates projects against a holistic set of distinct criteria, organised across the categories of Governance, Design, Liveability, Economic Prosperity Environment and Innovation.Achieving the QVMPR sustainability goals will not be without its challenges, such as ensuring that sustainability targets continue to be met throughout the implementation of the Program. To support this, a performance based approach has been adopted, including the use of the Greenstar rating system as the common sustainability framework for both individual buildings and across the precinct. The adoption of a partnership model incorporating all of the parties involved in the Program delivery, including the Council, the QVM management and the private developer(s) will also be instrumental in this regard.Another key challenge is that the market must remain operational throughout the renewal period. However, rather than detracting from the sustainability goals, this provides an opportunity to work with QVM management, traders and customers to engage and embed new behaviours and practices over the course of the Program, rather than waiting until its completion.While the Program is still in the early stages of implementation, from a sustainability perspective, success to date can be attributed to a number of factors including:<a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title="">[1]</a><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>

City Adviser Case Study Series: New York City - Buildings Technical Working Group
#################################################################################

            November 2016        In April 2016, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a suite of new building energy efficiency initiatives to address the largest source of  citywide greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions and place the city on a pathway to meeting the Mayor’s commitment to cut emissions by 80 percent from 2005 levels by 2050 (80 x 50). The 80 x 50 goal is one part of the City’s comprehensive OneNYC plan to make New York more sustainable, resilient and equitable. The building energy efficiency initiatives were based on the most comprehensive analysis of New York City building energy use to date and incorporated feedback from over 50 building sector leaders from the city’s world-class real estate, engineering, architecture, labor, affordable housing, academic, and advocacy sectors, who served on the Buildings Technical Working Group (TWG). As part of the analysis, the City conducted a comprehensive analysis of current energy use in existing buildings and growth projections under business as usual conditions. The City then analyzed the citywide GHG and cost impacts of nearly 100 energy conservation measures (ECMs), identified deep energy retrofits for eight typical building typologies in New York City that could achieve 40-60% reductions in energy use, and potential GHG reductions from various Energy Code update processes. Based on the findings from the analysis, the City will implement strategic measures to reduce building-based emissions that include developing a new local Energy Code that requires holistic energy performance, requiring comprehensive upgrades to heating distribution systems, integrating capital planning for deep energy reductions into existing energy audit requirements, and incorporating all ECMs identified into the City’s local building and energy codes.Collectively, the new body of research presented in the final TWG report provides a roadmap of the next steps building owners and operators will need to take in order for the city to achieve 80 x 50.  The City will begin implementing all strategic measures outlined in the report by 2022. The most immediate measures are projected to reduce GHG emissions by 2.7 million metric tons and save building owners roughly $900 million in energy costs each year. These measures also have the potential to create an estimated 1,300 direct construction-related jobs. Combined with the policies and programs announced in One City: Built to Last, the City’s preceding ten-year action plan to improve energy efficiency in buildings, current initiatives are now expected to reduce GHG emissions from existing buildings by a total of six million metric tons by 2025. Additional reductions will be achieved as the City incorporates cost-effective ECMs and performance-based standards into New York City codes. The full report, One City: Built to Last Technical Working Group Report: Transforming New York City Buildings for a Low-Carbon Future is available here: The TWG process included both comprehensive data-driven analysis and extensive stakeholder engagement to create a buildings-specific roadmap for 80 x 50 that has broad stakeholder support for major new initiatives.New York City utilized its unique datasets to analyze building emissions by typology, energy end use, and system type and assess the GHG reduction potential of nearly 100 ECMs, which will now be incorporated into the City’s local laws and codes. The City partnered with leading architects and engineers to develop and model deep energy retrofit paths for the most common building typologies in New York City, ultimately leading to agreement among stakeholders that energy reductions of 40-60% are possible using existing technologies and strategies in typical buildings. The results will be utilized to develop a template for large buildings to assess retrofit options as part of required energy audits, setting the foundation for future deep carbon reductions. The City also worked with leading technical experts to assess GHG reductions from incremental Energy Code updates out to 2050 and documented that these would not yield the reductions needed to achieve 80 x 50, leading to broad stakeholder support for developing a new performance-based Energy Code.The stakeholders that served as members of the TWG were key to the success of the plan. The recommended actions are the product of more than a year’s worth of engagement with these stakeholders. The full group met on twelve occasions, the four subcommittees met on twenty-two occasions. Staff of Mayor’s Office of Sustainability also met with a smaller group of strategic advisors on a biweekly basis and communicated with volunteer subcommittee leads on a weekly basis. The City also hosted one-on-one briefings with all organizations represented on the TWG that requested one and briefed every commissioner of a City agency with staff participating in the TWG twice.

City Adviser Case Study Series: City of Athens- Climate Action Plan
#################################################################################

            November 2016        In 2014, the City of Athens an active member of C40 since 2008, requested technical on-ground support to develop a Climate Action Plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change. The first step of the process concerned the development of a GPC-compliant greenhouse gas inventory. This inventory, apart from setting a baseline status, permits the monitoring of activities planned or already under implementation and allows for corrective actions, when necessary. At the same time, as equal importance has been given to adaptation, the climate action plan is used for increasing the city’s resilience to climate risks, improving the quality of life and ensuring a sustainable future for the next generations.The Climate Action Plan, being compatible with the objectives of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, sets an ambitious target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 40% until 2030, which is translated into approx. 2,000,000 t of CO2eq. The main activities concern the energy upgrade of the city’s very old building stock, public lighting and promotion of sustainable mobility options. The City, apart from undertaking actions for improving its own energy performance, will act as a role model for the private sector and the citizens setting the example for other stakeholders to follow. As a first and very important step for a city in the middle of a financial crisis, the rational use of energy in municipal buildings has led to a reduction of approx. 200,000 euros in energy costs.Adaptation is also considered a main pillar for increasing the city’s resilience and is actually part of the resilience strategy being developed by the City. Adapting to heat can bring multiple benefits that range from reduction of the cooling needs and the related energy consumption to the protection of vulnerable population and reduction of mortality rates. In addition, the use of green and blue infrastructures in the city and the adoption of nature-based solutions for a cooler and greener city are also expected to have a positive impact in air quality, which is of major importance for the quality of life in urban areas.Many factors have contributed to the success of the project, including the support of C40 staff and experience exchange from other cities through the involvement of Athens in C40 networks.  Seeing other cities’ examples and the results of initiatives that have taken place in other parts of the world acted as an inspiration for developing the climate action plan and selecting the actions tailored to the needs of the City of Athens. In addition, the experience that was transferred for overcoming barriers in implementing climate actions was also very helpful, as it helped the city avoid mistakes or solutions that would not be successful.The direct involvement of the city staff and their engagement was also of utmost importance. Raising awareness and making the staff part of the solution, as they have been actively involved in the development of the plan, was very positively received by the city directorates.In addition, the co-benefits that derive from climate actions were highlighted and were directly linked to the city’s resilience, economic activity of the city, the standards of living, the potential of job creation and social cohesion. In a city in a middle of a financial and social crisis, it is important to show that for example improving energy efficiency leads to reduction of operational costs and that the most vulnerable groups of citizens are protected against extreme weather events (i.e. heat waves).Finally, the C40 adviser programme and the presence of the City Adviser, helped to connect the Mayoral oﬃce to city oﬃcials on activities related to environment, energy and climate change (e.g. internal processes that the city needs to follow for operating more eﬀectively, the participation of the City of Athens in European-­‐funded projects in these ﬁelds, the evaluation of collaboration of the city with external stakeholders) and created the necessary mandate that the administration needed for taking action.

Cities100: Bogotá - Waste-to-Energy Project Supplies National Grid
#################################################################################

            November 2016        Bogotá is the first city in Colombia turning waste into electricity delivered to the grid, while investing a portion of the profits in social projects.Bogotá faced serious waste management challenges in the past, as the Doña Juana Landfill had received 2 million tons of waste annually,1 putting human health at risk and increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Under the Doña Juana Landfill Gas to Energy project, emissions are reduced by converting methane to electricity, and communities benefit from cleaner air as well as investments in their well- being from the profits.With the Doña Juana Landfill Gas to Energy project, Bogotá is capturing landfill biogas and turning it into electricity delivered to residents via the national grid. While the city had been capturing and destroying methane from landfill waste since 2009, this past year it became the first Colombian city to go a step further and create electricity from this waste. The process is undertaken at the landfill’s plant, which boasts one of the largest biogas systems in the country. The plant has a capacity of 30 MW of electricity, operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The project reduces CO2 emissions by 900,000 tons per year, and, by 2018, the city plans to construct two additional plants, further increasing the production of biogas and decreasing CO2 emissions. In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the project has an innovative social component. Twenty-four percent of the proceeds from the sale of carbon emission reduction credits and 4% of electricity sales are allocated to social investment in surrounding communities. Projects constructed with this funding include kindergartens, a multipurpose community center, pedestrian paths, and basic sanitation infrastructure, among other initiatives.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

            November 2016        Locals and students in Salvador are planting 20,000 native species as part of the Environmental Recovery Program of the Canabrava Park, beautifying an old waste dump and using treated sludge as fertilizer.Due to years of unregulated waste disposal, Canabrava Park is severely degraded, unable to sequester CO2 emissions, which increases the local temperature and spreads disease. Furthermore, approximately 8% of Salvador’s greenhouse gas emissions are the result of waste, 59% from wastewater plants. The Environmental Recovery Program is transforming the area by planting native trees and using treated sludge as fertilizer, capturing greenhouse gases, improving the local climate, and providing green spaces to one of the poorest neighborhoods in the city.Launched in 2015, Salvador’s Environmental Recovery Program of the Canabrava Park is reforesting an old 52,000 m2 outdoor dump that received 22 million tons of waste in the last year, while transforming the area into a new ecosystem and a much-needed green space for the underprivileged neighborhood. The Brazilian city’s program is planting 20,000 trees native to the Atlantic Forest biome, and using sludge from the city’s sewage, treated by anaerobic digestion, and biosolids from an industrial wastewater plant as fertilizer. Consequently, the project is a measure for CO2 sequestration and reduction, as well as local temperature control. The program is a partnership with the private sector, where different parties plant and maintain different sections of the park, creating ownership of the program. So far, two large plantations have been planted with the assistance of 300 participants, including environmental engineering students from the local university, and inhabitants of the surrounding areas. The program has encouraged the planting of even more trees, with a goal to reach 100,000 across the city in the coming years.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Cities100: Delhi - Turning Waste into Energy and Better Livelihoods
#################################################################################

            November 2016        A new waste-to-energy plant in Delhi is turning would-be landfill waste into a resource, while at the same time reducing illness, encouraging better livelihoods, cleaning the city, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Without intervention, Delhi expects to generate about 15,750 tons of garbage each day in 2021, which will further stress the city’s inadequate waste-to-landfill disposal system, exacerbating leachate, air pollution, and disease. Meanwhile, it is estimated that 60% of the population has experienced respiratory illness due to dumpsites. To address these concerns, Delhi is changing its waste management system with the introduction of the Ghazipur Waste to Energy Plant, preventing further environmental degradation and community agitation.Established in Delhi in 2011, the Ghazipur Waste to Energy Plant is India’s state-of-the-art facility, creating energy out of would-be landfill waste and contributing to the country’s goal of achieving 40% non-fossil fuel-based energy by 2030. The facility processes 2,000 tons of waste per day, generating 12 MW of power and 127 tons of fuel, which can be used in cement and power plants as an alternate source of energy. The plant has also invested heavily into air pollution control devices that conform to the European Industrial Emissions Directive, which is much more stringent than Indian norms. Estimates show that dumping of municipal solid waste at the Ghazipur dumpsite should drop by 90% within 25 years. In addition to reducing waste to landfill and generating power and fuel, the plant focuses on the community as well. The plant provided support to set up Gulmeher, a community center that provides about 200 local women, who previously earned a living picking waste at the Ghazipur dumpsite, with direct employment, capacity building, micro-enterprise support, and artisan training.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Cities100: Buenos Aires - Four Waste Streams Processed at One Facility
#################################################################################

            November 2016        The recently constructed Environmental Park in Buenos Aires has the ability to process construction and demolition, pruning, organic, and plastic waste, reducing waste sent to landfill and emissions, while saving money.In 2012, Buenos Aires sent more than 2 million metric tons of waste to landfill, generating a huge amount of greenhouse gas emissions and costing the city $18 per metric ton. In constructing the Environmental Park, with the ability to treat construction, pruning, organic and plastic waste, the city has reduced the amount of waste sent to landfill and, by doing so, reduced associated costs and greenhouse gases.The Environmental Park, constructed in 2012, processes almost 35% of waste generated in Buenos Aires, reducing waste sent to landfill and preventing greenhouse gas emissions. The Environmental Park processes four waste streams: construction and demolition, pruning waste, organic, and plastic, and includes an education center, making Buenos Aires one of the first cities in South America to process different waste streams at a single facility. Covering 85 hectares, the treatment plants and education center are connected by footbridges, allowing visitors to walk safely through the facility and learn the importance of recycling, reducing, and reusing waste as well as composting. In addition to reducing waste sent to landfill and educating the public, the Environmental Park was created using principles of sustainable design, with rainwater collected for irrigation, a solar thermotank, floors made from recycled materials, a green amphitheater, and native and non-native plants that create a forest curtain between the facility and the surrounding suburb. With the help of the Environmental Park, Buenos Aires aims to treat 100% of waste generated in the city by 2020.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Cities100: Kolkata - Segregating Waste Leads to a Better Quality of Life
#################################################################################

            November 2016        In an effort to end waste burning, Kolkata is segregating its waste under the Solid Waste Management Project, creating a cleaner, healthier city while raising community awareness.Mounds of waste at the Kolkata dumping site have measured up to 16 m high, causing land, water, air, and visual pollution. Furthermore, disposal of untreated sewage and waste dumping in the River Ganges has resulted in the extinction or endangerment of biodiversity in the area. The Kolkata Solid Waste Management Project has taken actions, through the segregation and appropriate management of waste, to reduce these hazards to the natural environment and the people of the city.The Kolkata Solid Waste Management Project encourages segregation of waste, a feat that had never been accomplished before in the city. Targeting 1 million people across six boroughs and covering over 65 km2 of land on the western bank of the River Ganges, the project focuses on recycling, composting organic waste, burying inert waste, and treating septic sludge. The project takes an engineering approach, through the development of infrastructure, but also incorporates a soft approach, including an eight year mass awareness program, ensuring community participation. A common Regional Waste Management Centre, which houses a sanitary landfill, leachate treatment plant, and septic tank sludge treatment plant, as well as five composting centers, have been constructed, as part of the project. Eventually, the ambitious project aims to reduce open dumping and waste burning by 100% and achieve 100% waste segregation at the source. In addition, the project will monitor air quality, reduce the concentration of landfill methane, and preserve groundwater within 50 m of the periphery of the Regional Waste Management Centre. Since the program launched, the rate of segregation has increased by up to 80%.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Cities100: Barcelona - Citizen Initiatives Drive Climate Action
#################################################################################

            November 2016        By collaborating with various civil society actors, Barcelona is engaging residents in developing citizen-led actions that address climate resilience.Home to a large population located on the Mediterranean basin, Barcelona faces a number of deep rooted problems related to climate change including high energy consumption and vulnerability to rising sea levels. To combat these challenges, the city is employing the power of collective local action to enact necessary changes to reduce emissions and improve resilience.In 2015, Barcelona adopted a bottom-up approach to mitigating climate change through its citizen-led initiative Commitment to Climate Change. The city invited more than 800 organizations including schools, businesses, and NGOs to participate in the process, resulting in the creation of nine citizen-centric projects. It is the city’s goal that these actions, along with city-led initiatives, will help Barcelona substantially reduce CO2 emissions and increase the total urban green area by 1.6 km2 by 2030. The nine citizen-centric plans include a bike-sharing program to encourage people to cycle to work and a mobile application that connects residents who want to swap goods and offer repairs. Another project will employ and train residents to renovate housing with passive and low cost systems to reduce energy consumption. All these projects work in synergy with Barcelona’s strategic measures to address climate change with the hope that the citizen driven process will ensure the city’s long-term commitment to climate action.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Cities100: Auckland - System Overhaul Reduces and Diverts Waste
#################################################################################

            November 2016        In a complete overhaul of the city’s waste management system, Auckland’s Waste to Resources project has put the city on track to achieve zero waste by 2040.In 2013, 9.3% of Auckland’s greenhouse gas emissions came from waste, with 1.2 million metrics tons sent to landfill in 2011. At the same time, around 65% of curbside collected waste could be recovered, re-used, or recycled. The Auckland Waste to Resources project mitigates these issues and puts the city on track to achieve zero waste status by 2040.In efforts to achieve zero waste by 2040, Auckland initiated the Waste to Resources project in 2012, diverting materials from the waste stream and improving resource efficiency throughout the city. As one of the biggest changes in waste management in the Southern Hemisphere, seven regional services were folded into one improved city-wide waste management system. The city aims to have new services rolled out progressively by 2020, such as a network of community-led resource recovery centers, a third bin collection for food waste, and a new inorganic waste service that diverts useful material to community organizations. Waste reduction is being encouraged through right-sizing of refuse bins and pay-as-you-throw pricing, while an innovative community-based approach is using creativity to engage residents in driving locally inspired and owned solutions. This active citizen engagement plays a critical part in helping the Waste to Resources project contribute to the city’s overall goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 40% by 2040.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Cities100: Cape Town - Turning Trashed Bins into Trash Bins
#################################################################################

            November 2016        Cape Town is recycling its old wheeled garbage collection bins, or “wheelie bins,” into new ones, diverting waste from landfill and adopting the concept of a circular economy.With increased urbanization and population growth in Cape Town, waste sent to landfill is growing, as is demand for city services. Therefore, diverting as much waste from landfill as possible is a city priority. The Fifty/50 Wheelie Bin program is a smart and targeted effort to achieve these goals, as recycling old wheelie bins into new bins not only diverts waste from landfill but lowers costs and reduces lifecycle CO2 emissions.Cape Town is giving new life to old, worn out, or damaged garbage collection wheelie bins by recycling them into new 240-L wheelie bins in an effort to circularize municipal waste management. With the project, the city’s Solid Waste Management Department embarked on its first closed-loop procurement scheme between a public authority and a private manufacturer. Launched in 2014, the Fifty/50 Wheelie Bin program utilizes 50% virgin material and 50% old bins that have been recycled, rather than using solely 100% virgin high-density polyethylene (HDPE). This has been identified as a safe ratio of virgin and recycled plastics based on months of research and development. Under this program, Cape Town is taking a targeted and progressive step towards implementing a new approach to recycling in local government. With the Fifty/50 Wheelie Bins estimated to have up to a 25% smaller environmental impact than manufacturing new bins, the project earned the city the South African Plastics Recycling Organization Trophy for the Recycled Product of the Year in 2015.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Cities100: Cape Town - Transformative Land Use Plan Supports Transit
#################################################################################

            November 2016        By integrating transport into its long-term development strategy, Cape Town will ensure that land use is best organized to suit residents’ needs and reduce greenhouse emissions.Due to sprawl, historical emphasis on road-based transport, and inequitable access to transit, Cape Town consumes a great deal of diesel, and transport, as a whole, is responsible for 34% of the city’s CO2 emissions. By directing its long-term strategic vision to address these systemic issues, Cape Town will not only reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, it will enable residents to navigate the city more efficiently.With its Transit Oriented Development Strategic Framework (TODSF), Cape Town is using transport as the the foundation of its long-term land use management and growth development, marking a paradigm shift for the city, which wants to become more compact and connected. The TODSF’s priorities include a modal shift towards public transport, the reduction of travel distances and costs, and the alleviation of urban sprawl through the optimization of land use. Concrete measures include a 12% improvement in access to transit and a 23% reduction in passenger kilometers traveled by 2032. To embark on this new vision, Cape Town developed an optimized transport scenario that will direct the organization of different land uses, including transport zones, public utilities, and businesses, and identify the actors necessary to deliver the new developments. To facilitate the uptake of the new directives, this focus on transit- oriented development will be embedded within all strategic and built environment plans of the city and will be used as a sustainable growth management tool.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

            November 2016        Curitiba is turning unused urban land into community gardens in order to improve food security and build social cohesion, while raising awareness about the environmental impacts of commercial food production.In Curitiba, swathes of land have long been treated as garbage disposal sites. By repurposing this land for community urban agriculture, the city is boosting resilience to climate change by simultaneously targeting food security and urban vegetation cover.The Urban Agriculture program in Curitiba is a community project that rehabilitates degraded land, and makes use of vacant space in private and public locations, including schools, backyards, and balconies, to produce food. Through local organic food production, the city hopes to mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions caused by the transport of food as well as enable more carbon sequestration from increased vegetation. In addition, the urban agriculture project increases food security and can serve as an income generating activity for participants. Since its launch in 2011, the initiative has generated more than 750 tons of food and has benefited more than 83,000 people. The program also fosters social inclusion by providing a therapeutic group activity for a diverse group of participants, including children and the elderly and those afflicted by drug addiction and mental health issues. Environmental awareness and education is also a key element of the project, which offers training activities, including home composting, alternative methods of cultivation, pest control, and soil conservation.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

            November 2016        In redeveloping the industrial Kowloon East brownfield into a thriving business district, Hong Kong is using innovative infrastructure to reduce energy consumption, improve mobility, and conserve resources.Hong Kong had the double challenge to render Kowloon East economically attractive while ensuring the area’s CO2 mitigating abilities and resilience to climate change in the face of increasing water levels. The city integrated green development directives and policy into the neighborhood’s redevelopment plan to ensure that climate impacts were mitigated.The Energizing Kowloon East redevelopment project aims not only to transform Kowloon East into an additional central business district of Hong Kong but also a resilient, low-carbon community. To achieve this, the city has installed a large-scale district cooling system, serving about 1.73 million m2 of floor space. Furthermore, both new and existing buildings in the district will have to adopt green certifications and provide electric vehicle charging facilities. So far, the 30 green building projects in Kowloon East have reduced CO2 emissions by 56,100 metric tons annually. In addition to reductions in energy use, the city is promoting active mobility in Kowloon East by improving walkability and well-integrated pedestrian networks. The district is also conscious of its adaptation measures, working to improve drainage and water quality while ramping up flood protection capacity. Boosting this effort, one-third of Kowloon East will be public space, and 60% of that land will consist of green areas.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

            November 2016        By using smart sensors and development contracts tied to environmental standards, Auckland is ensuring the climate resilience and energy efficiency of its largest waterfront redevelopment project.New Zealand is experiencing growth in many urban areas, but development often happens in a haphazard way without consideration for environmental impacts and climate adaptation measures, especially flooding risks. Utilizing neighborhood data and smart infrastructure, Wynyard Quarter is demonstrating replicable practices to both mitigate and adapt to climate change at a district scale.Data capture and reporting through neighborhood-scale smart infrastructure is central to Auckland’s largest urban regeneration project to date: Wynyard Quarter, an 18-hectare former brownfield waterfront site. From the plan’s inception in 2011, the city has enforced strict environmental performance targets and is using state-of-the art sensors to gather detailed data on the project’s goals, including energy efficiency, sustainable transport, and climate adaptation. The data collected will enable the city to monitor the environmental performance of Wynyard Quarter over time. Environmental standards were integrated in the development’s construction contracts to ensure that the city’s goals are met. With these measures, the city wants to reach a respective 48% and 79% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from energy and transport compared to business as usual in Wynyard Quarter. Special attention was also given to the climate resilience of the waterfront project, with the incorporation of sustainable design features like stormwater infrastructure, rainwater harvesting, and waterproof basement pumping stations.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

While the area’s space constraints promote mobility, the district needed to improve its energy efficiency as well. Therefore, Wuhan initiated a holistic low-carbon approach to the neighborhood’s development that engages residents and incentivizes the uptake of green technologies.As part of Wuhan’s Low-Carbon City Pilot Program, Baibuting, a community of 150,000 people living on 5.5 km2, is infusing a low-carbon philosophy into its strategic development goals. Launched in 2011, some of the main directives guiding Baibuting’s development are affordable, energy efficient housing, convenient transport, and access to green space and essential services. According to the area’s development strategy, housing construction is encouraged to incorporate low-carbon and climate-resilient technologies. So far, developers’ investment in renewable energy has yielded a geothermal heat pump heating and cooling system and solar powered water heaters for the community’s benefit. Baibuting’s strategy focuses not only on physical improvements but also on the importance of instilling a low-carbon culture and environmentally responsible habits among residents. With the help of 40,000 volunteers, almost a third of the population, the Baibuting council helps residents adopt a green lifestyle by, among other initiatives, bringing awareness to power and water savings and clarifying waste separation guidelines.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

            November 2016        Retrofit One is an innovative financing mechanism that utilizes guaranteed energy savings and private investors to fund energy efficiency upgrades to Chicago’s public infrastructure.In Chicago, building energy use represents 71% of city-wide greenhouse gas emissions, and residents and businesses spend more than $3 billion per year to operate buildings. Retrofit One is the first of several CIT initiatives enabling Chicago to overhaul its aging infrastructure and undertake upgrades necessary for efficient energy use.In 2012, the Chicago Infrastructure Trust (CIT), a financing vehicle used to secure private capital for innovative public infrastructure, inaugurated its pilot project, Retrofit One. It raised $13.7 million for 114 energy efficiency projects, including advanced lighting management and building automation systems, in 60 public buildings in 2015. An Energy Savings Agreement serves as the core financing structure for the project, and municipal cost savings accruing from saved energy are shared with private investors according to specific terms. The agreement also includes a conditional payment structure requiring participating energy service companies to guarantee minimum project savings over 14 years. To date, the scheme has generated $1.4 million in annual cost savings and profit for investors. By involving third party financing, the project will contribute to Chicago’s Climate Action Plan, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050, while minimizing both energy project risk and the city’s financial responsibility.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Yet, as a coastal city vulnerable to severe weather and sea level rise, Boston still requires significant investments in resilience and energy efficiency upgrades. The RBT helps solve this challenge by using a tried-and-true model to fund improvements to critical-but-underserved projects.Boston has launched the Renew Boston Trust (RBT) in an effort to improve energy efficiency and resilience upgrades in the city’s building stock by using a self-funded financing model. The system builds upon the idea of energy performance contracting, in which energy savings are used to finance investments. With RBT, operating savings from energy efficiency and renewable energy measures pay not only for those investments, but excess savings pay for resilience investments, which traditionally do not produce operating savings by themselves. While the current program primarily targets municipal properties, RBT is working to apply innovative financing models to the institutional and nonprofit sector as well, via a tax-exempt lease program that would aggregate small projects, allowing non-profits to reduce upfront costs and improve financing through economies of scale. When implemented, the expanded RBT is expected to achieve a 10-fold increase in funding for energy efficiency and resilience projects and accelerate achievement of the city’s Climate Action Plan emissions reduction goals.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Cities100: New York City - Low-Cost Financing Enables Affordable Housing Retrofits
#################################################################################

            November 2016        New York City’s new program maintains housing affordability while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions by providing energy audits and low-cost financing to small property owners.Thirty-five percent of New York’s emissions come from residential buildings; however, many small or medium property owners do not have the means to undertake retrofits as they also face mounting utility and operating costs. GHPP enables the city’s affordable housing sector to undertake upgrades and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining housing affordabilityNew York City’s Green Housing Preservation Program (GHPP) aims to reduce housing costs and greenhouse gas emissions in the city’s affordable housing sector by easing barriers to undertake energy efficiency and water conservation improvements. Under the program, property owners, who often perceive housing improvements as out of reach, gain access to energy audit information and low- or no-cost financing for key retrofit measures. With improvements such as the installation of efficiency controls, it is anticipated that owners may see more than a 10% annual reduction in utility costs, which account for roughly 25% of the average operating budget of a rent stabilized building. GHPP has the potential to impact a large number of owners and tenants in the city, as almost two-thirds of New York’s rental apartment buildings are eligible for the program. In addition to securing the climate resilience of owners and tenants in low- to moderate-income neighborhoods, the initiative is an important aspect of the city’s plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings by 30% below 2005 levels by 2025.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

SNAP programs succeed in promoting change and increasing community resilience while fully engaging residents in the process.Toronto’s Sustainable Neighbourhood Retrofit Action Plan (SNAP) is a locally tailored home retrofit program reaching both homeowners and renters with building upgrades and community enhancement initiatives. Assisting residents from planning to implementation of projects, SNAP simultaneously targets energy conservation, urban forest enhancement, water conservation, and stormwater management, as well as local food production in order to create more resilient neighborhoods. In the Black Creek neighborhood, a community of 25,000 people which was home to one of SNAP’s six pilot projects, positive results have already been observed; 88% of participants have undertaken at least one retrofit action since the program launched in 2012. One SNAP program underway in Black Creek, Harvest the Rain, has distributed 217 rain barrels to residents in an effort to protect against basement flooding while using the collected water to support vegetable gardens and tree planting. City-wide, SNAP measures are expected to reduce stormwater runoff and pollutants from private lots by 30%, expand urban forest cover by 8%, and reduce electricity use by 10%.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

            November 2016        Washington, D.C.’s application of PACE financing to an affordable housing project is saving the property money as it promotes climate and energy equity.Affordable housing properties and non-profits often have major deferred maintenance needs and struggle with the burden of high utility bills. Additionally, the upfront cost of efficiency improvements can put these technologies out of reach for many. By applying PACE financing to an affordable housing project, Washington, D.C. is bringing sustainability measures to an underserved market and proving that green retrofits and housing affordability can be mutually reinforcing.Washington, D.C. is using the Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing tool, along with public housing capital funds and private investment, to support the $16.8 million rehabilitation of the Phyllis Wheatley YWCA, which hosts 82 units of affordable housing for homeless women in transition in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood. PACE provided 100% of the upfront capital for the project, which includes high-efficiency HVAC equipment and controls, lighting, domestic water heating, and plumbing systems, as well as a 32.7 kW solar PV system, which together will reduce energy consumption by 25%. While PACE financing is available in most of the USA, this project marks the first time it has been approved for a Department of Housing and Urban Development-assisted mixed finance public housing property. By making it work in tandem with affordable housing subsidies, the novel mechanism enables rents to remain low enough so the property can remain as public affordable housing for at least 40 years, while at the same time it decreases its ecological footprint.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments. You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Cities100: Auckland - Revolving Fund Yields Large Municipal Savings
#################################################################################

            November 2016        A revolving fund enables Auckland to invest money flowing from municipal energy-saving projects into additional energy efficiency improvements.Without intervention, Auckland’s greenhouse gas emissions could increase by 46% by 2025 and energy use by 65% by 2040. Moreover, the city spends nearly 5% of its gross regional product on energy. Through the revolving fund mechanism, Auckland is curbing its energy use and demonstrating that significant savings and efficiencies can be gained while minimizing costs for taxpayers.Auckland is using a revolving fund to finance energy efficiency upgrades in city-owned or managed buildings. The fund was first granted $700,000 in 2013 to invest in innovation and improvements of public-owned buildings; the savings achieved by the gains in efficiency have been reinvested in additional projects. To date, the retrofit of the Auckland Council Headquarters led to a 39% decrease in energy use and annual savings of $377,000. Additionally, the city’s outfitting of 40,000 streetlights with LEDs, and the addition of a tele-management system, will result in a total net savings of $30 million over 20 years. As the Council has 1,816 buildings under its jurisdiction, Auckland has a wide scope to scale up improvements and achieve important savings via the revolving fund. In addition to addressing the climate-proofing needs of city-owned buildings, the project demonstrates the viability of energy efficiency investments and can act as a guide for building owners and the entire building industry across New Zealand.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Retrofit One is the first of several CIT initiatives enabling Chicago to overhaul its aging infrastructure and undertake upgrades necessary for efficient energy use.In 2012, the Chicago Infrastructure Trust (CIT), a financing vehicle used to secure private capital for innovative public infrastructure, inaugurated its pilot project, Retrofit One. It raised $13.7 million for 114 energy efficiency projects, including advanced lighting management and building automation systems, in 60 public buildings in 2015. An Energy Savings Agreement serves as the core financing structure for the project, and municipal cost savings accruing from saved energy are shared with private investors according to specific terms. The agreement also includes a conditional payment structure requiring participating energy service companies to guarantee minimum project savings over 14 years. To date, the scheme has generated $1.4 million in annual cost savings and profit for investors. By involving third party financing, the project will contribute to Chicago’s Climate Action Plan, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050, while minimizing both energy project risk and the city’s financial responsibility.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

            November 2016        By focusing on infrastructure development and community engagement, Baibuting, a densely built community in Wuhan, is successfully integrating a low-carbon philosophy into its strategic development.Residents of Baibuting live in a very dense area in one of China’s most populous cities. While the area’s space constraints promote mobility, the district needed to improve its energy efficiency as well. Therefore, Wuhan initiated a holistic low-carbon approach to the neighborhood’s development that engages residents and incentivizes the uptake of green technologies.As part of Wuhan’s Low-Carbon City Pilot Program, Baibuting, a community of 150,000 people living on 5.5 km2, is infusing a low-carbon philosophy into its strategic development goals. Launched in 2011, some of the main directives guiding Baibuting’s development are affordable, energy efficient housing, convenient transport, and access to green space and essential services. According to the area’s development strategy, housing construction is encouraged to incorporate low-carbon and climate-resilient technologies. So far, developers’ investment in renewable energy has yielded a geothermal heat pump heating and cooling system and solar powered water heaters for the community’s benefit. Baibuting’s strategy focuses not only on physical improvements but also on the importance of instilling a low-carbon culture and environmentally responsible habits among residents. With the help of 40,000 volunteers, almost a third of the population, the Baibuting council helps residents adopt a green lifestyle by, among other initiatives, bringing awareness to power and water savings and clarifying waste separation guidelines.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Cities100: New York City - Low-Cost Financing Enables Affordable Housing Retrofits
#################################################################################

            November 2016        New York City’s new program maintains housing affordability while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions by providing energy audits and low-cost financing to small property owners.Thirty-five percent of New York’s emissions come from residential buildings; however, many small or medium property owners do not have the means to undertake retrofits as they also face mounting utility and operating costs. GHPP enables the city’s affordable housing sector to undertake upgrades and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining housing affordabilityNew York City’s Green Housing Preservation Program (GHPP) aims to reduce housing costs and greenhouse gas emissions in the city’s affordable housing sector by easing barriers to undertake energy efficiency and water conservation improvements. Under the program, property owners, who often perceive housing improvements as out of reach, gain access to energy audit information and low- or no-cost financing for key retrofit measures. With improvements such as the installation of efficiency controls, it is anticipated that owners may see more than a 10% annual reduction in utility costs, which account for roughly 25% of the average operating budget of a rent stabilized building. GHPP has the potential to impact a large number of owners and tenants in the city, as almost two-thirds of New York’s rental apartment buildings are eligible for the program. In addition to securing the climate resilience of owners and tenants in low- to moderate-income neighborhoods, the initiative is an important aspect of the city’s plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings by 30% below 2005 levels by 2025.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

The city integrated green development directives and policy into the neighborhood’s redevelopment plan to ensure that climate impacts were mitigated.The Energizing Kowloon East redevelopment project aims not only to transform Kowloon East into an additional central business district of Hong Kong but also a resilient, low-carbon community. To achieve this, the city has installed a large-scale district cooling system, serving about 1.73 million m2 of floor space. Furthermore, both new and existing buildings in the district will have to adopt green certifications and provide electric vehicle charging facilities. So far, the 30 green building projects in Kowloon East have reduced CO2 emissions by 56,100 metric tons annually. In addition to reductions in energy use, the city is promoting active mobility in Kowloon East by improving walkability and well-integrated pedestrian networks. The district is also conscious of its adaptation measures, working to improve drainage and water quality while ramping up flood protection capacity. Boosting this effort, one-third of Kowloon East will be public space, and 60% of that land will consist of green areas.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

            November 2016        To ensure Stockholm’s sustainable growth for years to come, the city has underpinned its development strategy on active mobility, public transport and efficient use of space.Stockholm is one of Europe’s fastest growing cities. The sustainability of its future growth and development depends on planning policies enacted today. In this context, the city is embracing a holistic development plan with a focus on connectivity, active mobility, and public transport to ensure equitable growth and climate resilience.Stockholm believes that making the city denser and more connected is indispensable to creating a thriving city that can grow equitably and sustainably in the face of challenges from globalization and climate change. With its new city-wide plan, Walkable City, Stockholm is promoting walking, cycling, and public transport as well as efficient use of space over driving. To deliver on this vision, the city has extended its bicycle network by 7,000 m in 2015 and utilized measures like a congestion tax, which fines car use in the city center, to invest in walking, cycling, and public transport infrastructure. The mobility plan is crucial in helping Stockholm reach its goal of eliminating CO2 emissions attributable to transport by 2030. Ensuring that sustainable growth occurs not only in the city center but also in peripheral communities, Walkable City Stockholm is investing in key strategic transit nodes to connect the entire city. In doing so, the city will not only boost its climate resilience and lower CO2 emissions but also reduce social disparities between neighborhoods by improving access to the city’s services and unlocking economic opportunities for all residents.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

By repurposing this land for community urban agriculture, the city is boosting resilience to climate change by simultaneously targeting food security and urban vegetation cover.The Urban Agriculture program in Curitiba is a community project that rehabilitates degraded land, and makes use of vacant space in private and public locations, including schools, backyards, and balconies, to produce food. Through local organic food production, the city hopes to mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions caused by the transport of food as well as enable more carbon sequestration from increased vegetation. In addition, the urban agriculture project increases food security and can serve as an income generating activity for participants. Since its launch in 2011, the initiative has generated more than 750 tons of food and has benefited more than 83,000 people. The program also fosters social inclusion by providing a therapeutic group activity for a diverse group of participants, including children and the elderly and those afflicted by drug addiction and mental health issues. Environmental awareness and education is also a key element of the project, which offers training activities, including home composting, alternative methods of cultivation, pest control, and soil conservation.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Cities100: Stockholm - Walkable City Drives Long-Term Growth
#################################################################################

            November 2016        To ensure Stockholm’s sustainable growth for years to come, the city has underpinned its development strategy on active mobility, public transport and efficient use of space.Stockholm is one of Europe’s fastest growing cities. The sustainability of its future growth and development depends on planning policies enacted today. In this context, the city is embracing a holistic development plan with a focus on connectivity, active mobility, and public transport to ensure equitable growth and climate resilience.Stockholm believes that making the city denser and more connected is indispensable to creating a thriving city that can grow equitably and sustainably in the face of challenges from globalization and climate change. With its new city-wide plan, Walkable City, Stockholm is promoting walking, cycling, and public transport as well as efficient use of space over driving. To deliver on this vision, the city has extended its bicycle network by 7,000 m in 2015 and utilized measures like a congestion tax, which fines car use in the city center, to invest in walking, cycling, and public transport infrastructure. The mobility plan is crucial in helping Stockholm reach its goal of eliminating CO2 emissions attributable to transport by 2030. Ensuring that sustainable growth occurs not only in the city center but also in peripheral communities, Walkable City Stockholm is investing in key strategic transit nodes to connect the entire city. In doing so, the city will not only boost its climate resilience and lower CO2 emissions but also reduce social disparities between neighborhoods by improving access to the city’s services and unlocking economic opportunities for all residents.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Cities100: Barcelona - Citizen Initiatives Drive Climate Action
#################################################################################

            November 2016        By collaborating with various civil society actors, Barcelona is engaging residents in developing citizen-led actions that address climate resilience.Home to a large population located on the Mediterranean basin, Barcelona faces a number of deep rooted problems related to climate change including high energy consumption and vulnerability to rising sea levels. To combat these challenges, the city is employing the power of collective local action to enact necessary changes to reduce emissions and improve resilience.In 2015, Barcelona adopted a bottom-up approach to mitigating climate change through its citizen-led initiative Commitment to Climate Change. The city invited more than 800 organizations including schools, businesses, and NGOs to participate in the process, resulting in the creation of nine citizen-centric projects. It is the city’s goal that these actions, along with city-led initiatives, will help Barcelona substantially reduce CO2 emissions and increase the total urban green area by 1.6 km2 by 2030. The nine citizen-centric plans include a bike-sharing program to encourage people to cycle to work and a mobile application that connects residents who want to swap goods and offer repairs. Another project will employ and train residents to renovate housing with passive and low cost systems to reduce energy consumption. All these projects work in synergy with Barcelona’s strategic measures to address climate change with the hope that the citizen driven process will ensure the city’s long-term commitment to climate action.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Cities100: Auckland - System Overhaul Reduces and Diverts Waste
#################################################################################

            November 2016        In a complete overhaul of the city’s waste management system, Auckland’s Waste to Resources project has put the city on track to achieve zero waste by 2040.In 2013, 9.3% of Auckland’s greenhouse gas emissions came from waste, with 1.2 million metrics tons sent to landfill in 2011. At the same time, around 65% of curbside collected waste could be recovered, re-used, or recycled. The Auckland Waste to Resources project mitigates these issues and puts the city on track to achieve zero waste status by 2040.In efforts to achieve zero waste by 2040, Auckland initiated the Waste to Resources project in 2012, diverting materials from the waste stream and improving resource efficiency throughout the city. As one of the biggest changes in waste management in the Southern Hemisphere, seven regional services were folded into one improved city-wide waste management system. The city aims to have new services rolled out progressively by 2020, such as a network of community-led resource recovery centers, a third bin collection for food waste, and a new inorganic waste service that diverts useful material to community organizations. Waste reduction is being encouraged through right-sizing of refuse bins and pay-as-you-throw pricing, while an innovative community-based approach is using creativity to engage residents in driving locally inspired and owned solutions. This active citizen engagement plays a critical part in helping the Waste to Resources project contribute to the city’s overall goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 40% by 2040.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

            November 2016        Quito is reducing emissions and changing the definition of waste by generating clean energy, creating compost, and recycling paper and cardboard as part of the Organic Waste and Climate Change project.In Quito, an average of 1,877 tons of waste is sent to the Inga landfill per year, accounting for 13% of the city’s carbon footprint. Sixty percent of waste in Inga landfill is organic, and its decomposition results in the generation of methane, contributing to climate change. By recycling, composting, and generating biogas through the Organic Waste and Climate Change project, Quito is reducing emissions and giving waste a new purpose.Under its Development and Land Use Plan, in 2015 Quito launched an integrated waste management project based on the concept of a circular economy, while encouraging social and environmental co-responsibility. The Organic Waste and Climate Change project has three elements: generate 5 MW of electricity by 2017 with landfill biogas, process 12 million tons of organic waste into compost through the construction of a municipal organic waste processing plant, and improve paper and cardboard recycling by means of waste recovery, processing, and commercialization. The project aims to achieve a 33% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from waste, which is equivalent to approximately 300,000 tons of CO2, by 2017. Citizen engagement is key to the project’s success, and has been carried out using a combination of outreach campaigns, public meetings, environmental forums, and social media. Information about the project has been made open and transparent for everyone, aiming to include all sectors of society in decision-making.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Cities100: Kolkata - Segregating Waste Leads to a Better Quality of Life
#################################################################################

            November 2016        In an effort to end waste burning, Kolkata is segregating its waste under the Solid Waste Management Project, creating a cleaner, healthier city while raising community awareness.Mounds of waste at the Kolkata dumping site have measured up to 16 m high, causing land, water, air, and visual pollution. Furthermore, disposal of untreated sewage and waste dumping in the River Ganges has resulted in the extinction or endangerment of biodiversity in the area. The Kolkata Solid Waste Management Project has taken actions, through the segregation and appropriate management of waste, to reduce these hazards to the natural environment and the people of the city.The Kolkata Solid Waste Management Project encourages segregation of waste, a feat that had never been accomplished before in the city. Targeting 1 million people across six boroughs and covering over 65 km2 of land on the western bank of the River Ganges, the project focuses on recycling, composting organic waste, burying inert waste, and treating septic sludge. The project takes an engineering approach, through the development of infrastructure, but also incorporates a soft approach, including an eight year mass awareness program, ensuring community participation. A common Regional Waste Management Centre, which houses a sanitary landfill, leachate treatment plant, and septic tank sludge treatment plant, as well as five composting centers, have been constructed, as part of the project. Eventually, the ambitious project aims to reduce open dumping and waste burning by 100% and achieve 100% waste segregation at the source. In addition, the project will monitor air quality, reduce the concentration of landfill methane, and preserve groundwater within 50 m of the periphery of the Regional Waste Management Centre. Since the program launched, the rate of segregation has increased by up to 80%.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Cities100: Buenos Aires - Four Waste Streams Processed at One Facility
#################################################################################

            November 2016        The recently constructed Environmental Park in Buenos Aires has the ability to process construction and demolition, pruning, organic, and plastic waste, reducing waste sent to landfill and emissions, while saving money.In 2012, Buenos Aires sent more than 2 million metric tons of waste to landfill, generating a huge amount of greenhouse gas emissions and costing the city $18 per metric ton. In constructing the Environmental Park, with the ability to treat construction, pruning, organic and plastic waste, the city has reduced the amount of waste sent to landfill and, by doing so, reduced associated costs and greenhouse gases.The Environmental Park, constructed in 2012, processes almost 35% of waste generated in Buenos Aires, reducing waste sent to landfill and preventing greenhouse gas emissions. The Environmental Park processes four waste streams: construction and demolition, pruning waste, organic, and plastic, and includes an education center, making Buenos Aires one of the first cities in South America to process different waste streams at a single facility. Covering 85 hectares, the treatment plants and education center are connected by footbridges, allowing visitors to walk safely through the facility and learn the importance of recycling, reducing, and reusing waste as well as composting. In addition to reducing waste sent to landfill and educating the public, the Environmental Park was created using principles of sustainable design, with rainwater collected for irrigation, a solar thermotank, floors made from recycled materials, a green amphitheater, and native and non-native plants that create a forest curtain between the facility and the surrounding suburb. With the help of the Environmental Park, Buenos Aires aims to treat 100% of waste generated in the city by 2020.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Cities100: Delhi - Turning Waste into Energy and Better Livelihoods
#################################################################################

            November 2016        A new waste-to-energy plant in Delhi is turning would-be landfill waste into a resource, while at the same time reducing illness, encouraging better livelihoods, cleaning the city, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Without intervention, Delhi expects to generate about 15,750 tons of garbage each day in 2021, which will further stress the city’s inadequate waste-to-landfill disposal system, exacerbating leachate, air pollution, and disease. Meanwhile, it is estimated that 60% of the population has experienced respiratory illness due to dumpsites. To address these concerns, Delhi is changing its waste management system with the introduction of the Ghazipur Waste to Energy Plant, preventing further environmental degradation and community agitation.Established in Delhi in 2011, the Ghazipur Waste to Energy Plant is India’s state-of-the-art facility, creating energy out of would-be landfill waste and contributing to the country’s goal of achieving 40% non-fossil fuel-based energy by 2030. The facility processes 2,000 tons of waste per day, generating 12 MW of power and 127 tons of fuel, which can be used in cement and power plants as an alternate source of energy. The plant has also invested heavily into air pollution control devices that conform to the European Industrial Emissions Directive, which is much more stringent than Indian norms. Estimates show that dumping of municipal solid waste at the Ghazipur dumpsite should drop by 90% within 25 years. In addition to reducing waste to landfill and generating power and fuel, the plant focuses on the community as well. The plant provided support to set up Gulmeher, a community center that provides about 200 local women, who previously earned a living picking waste at the Ghazipur dumpsite, with direct employment, capacity building, micro-enterprise support, and artisan training.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

            November 2016        Bogotá is the first city in Colombia turning waste into electricity delivered to the grid, while investing a portion of the profits in social projects.Bogotá faced serious waste management challenges in the past, as the Doña Juana Landfill had received 2 million tons of waste annually,1 putting human health at risk and increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Under the Doña Juana Landfill Gas to Energy project, emissions are reduced by converting methane to electricity, and communities benefit from cleaner air as well as investments in their well- being from the profits.With the Doña Juana Landfill Gas to Energy project, Bogotá is capturing landfill biogas and turning it into electricity delivered to residents via the national grid. While the city had been capturing and destroying methane from landfill waste since 2009, this past year it became the first Colombian city to go a step further and create electricity from this waste. The process is undertaken at the landfill’s plant, which boasts one of the largest biogas systems in the country. The plant has a capacity of 30 MW of electricity, operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The project reduces CO2 emissions by 900,000 tons per year, and, by 2018, the city plans to construct two additional plants, further increasing the production of biogas and decreasing CO2 emissions. In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the project has an innovative social component. Twenty-four percent of the proceeds from the sale of carbon emission reduction credits and 4% of electricity sales are allocated to social investment in surrounding communities. Projects constructed with this funding include kindergartens, a multipurpose community center, pedestrian paths, and basic sanitation infrastructure, among other initiatives.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Furthermore, approximately 8% of Salvador’s greenhouse gas emissions are the result of waste, 59% from wastewater plants. The Environmental Recovery Program is transforming the area by planting native trees and using treated sludge as fertilizer, capturing greenhouse gases, improving the local climate, and providing green spaces to one of the poorest neighborhoods in the city.Launched in 2015, Salvador’s Environmental Recovery Program of the Canabrava Park is reforesting an old 52,000 m2 outdoor dump that received 22 million tons of waste in the last year, while transforming the area into a new ecosystem and a much-needed green space for the underprivileged neighborhood. The Brazilian city’s program is planting 20,000 trees native to the Atlantic Forest biome, and using sludge from the city’s sewage, treated by anaerobic digestion, and biosolids from an industrial wastewater plant as fertilizer. Consequently, the project is a measure for CO2 sequestration and reduction, as well as local temperature control. The program is a partnership with the private sector, where different parties plant and maintain different sections of the park, creating ownership of the program. So far, two large plantations have been planted with the assistance of 300 participants, including environmental engineering students from the local university, and inhabitants of the surrounding areas.

Cities100: Cape Town - Turning Trashed Bins into Trash Bins
#################################################################################

            November 2016        Cape Town is recycling its old wheeled garbage collection bins, or “wheelie bins,” into new ones, diverting waste from landfill and adopting the concept of a circular economy.With increased urbanization and population growth in Cape Town, waste sent to landfill is growing, as is demand for city services. Therefore, diverting as much waste from landfill as possible is a city priority. The Fifty/50 Wheelie Bin program is a smart and targeted effort to achieve these goals, as recycling old wheelie bins into new bins not only diverts waste from landfill but lowers costs and reduces lifecycle CO2 emissions.Cape Town is giving new life to old, worn out, or damaged garbage collection wheelie bins by recycling them into new 240-L wheelie bins in an effort to circularize municipal waste management. With the project, the city’s Solid Waste Management Department embarked on its first closed-loop procurement scheme between a public authority and a private manufacturer. Launched in 2014, the Fifty/50 Wheelie Bin program utilizes 50% virgin material and 50% old bins that have been recycled, rather than using solely 100% virgin high-density polyethylene (HDPE). This has been identified as a safe ratio of virgin and recycled plastics based on months of research and development. Under this program, Cape Town is taking a targeted and progressive step towards implementing a new approach to recycling in local government.

Cities100: Boston - Data and Stakeholders Build Adaptation Roadmap
#################################################################################

            November 2016        Boston has taken a data- and stakeholder-driven approach to climate adaptation, creating Climate Ready Boston in an effort to develop projections, assess risks, and create resilience strategies.Extreme weather events such as Hurricane Sandy and winter storm Juno make it increasingly important for the City of Boston to prepare for impacts relating to climate change. By developing an understanding of projected climate change impacts, assessing how these will affect the city, and forming strategies to tackle these impacts, Climate Ready Boston ensures that the city is ready for the next extreme weather event, while adapting to long-term effects of climate change.Born out of the city’s 2014 Climate Action Plan, Climate Ready Boston was launched in 2015 as an initiative to develop resilient solutions to the impacts of long-term climate change. The initiative has three key deliverables: consensus on updated projections on the impacts of climate change; an integrated vulnerability assessment of these impacts, including identification of neighborhoods, properties, and infrastructure assets that are most at risk; and specific resilience strategies and a guiding roadmap that will reduce the city’s vulnerabilities and prioritize implementation. Based on data and stakeholder engagement, these strategies will include a portfolio of solutions and interventions, such as policies, regulations, financial incentives, and design standards. The initiative has not only provided the city with physical damage estimates, such as the cost of repairing buildings and infrastructure, but also costs to the community, at-risk individuals, business operations, and social networks. This has been possible through comprehensive cross-sector partnerships, which have funded the program, supplied data, and discussed and implemented recommendations. These partnerships include more than 30 stakeholder committees, including city, state, and private sector agencies and community groups, that participate on an advisory level.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Cities100: Dubai - Decision Support System Sends Extreme Weather Warnings
#################################################################################

            November 2016        Dubai created a Decision Support System using the latest weather forecasting technology in order to predict extreme weather events and protect the city’s coastline.The Dubai coastline faces many risks because of climate change. Sea level is forecast to rise a minimum of 4 mm annually, while storm events are expected to be more frequent and severe. The Decision Support System for Marine and Waterways Management has integrated the latest technology to forecast extreme weather events and flooding, enabling the city to better respond and adapt to these climate change challenges.Dubai launched its Decision Support System for Marine and Waterways Management in 2012, the first of its kind in the region, reducing climate change-induced risks to the coastal zone. The system consists of an integrated suite of meteorological, hydrodynamic, and wave models, combined with real- time data management and Web-based tools, creating a coastal monitoring and forecasting system. The system has been successful in predicting extreme weather events 24 hours in advance, delivering data and decision support to the municipality and public users on everything from sea level rise; change in wave frequency, height, and direction; increased precipitation rates; coastal erosion; and increased sea water acidity. Not just providing actionable, real-time information, the system has allowed for the creation of a comprehensive historical database, as well as a coastal inundation tool, capable of forecasting and mapping the extent of coastal flooding. By collecting weather and oceanographic information, the municipality is able to account for future risks of climate change in its infrastructure planning and design for the Dubai coastline.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Cities100: Toronto - Adaptation Report Informs Cross-Sector Collaboration
#################################################################################

            November 2016        Toronto published a policy report outlining an approach that will see climate change resilience integrated into decision-making and coordination across city agencies and with private sector partners.In addition to flooding and winter storms, Toronto faces increased instances of heat waves, with modeling suggesting that by 2040- 2050 daily maximum temperatures could reach 44°C. To adapt to these pressing concerns, Toronto is laying the groundwork for action through the Resilient City report, ensuring that services and operations – both in and outside the city’s jurisdiction – are coordinated.In 2014, Toronto unveiled Resilient City – Preparing for a Changing Climate, a policy paper that lays the groundwork for comprehensive adaptation action. The report outlines how climate change resilience can be integrated into decision-making and coordination of city operations and services. Furthermore, it proposes specific recommendations, such as the creation of a geospatial risk assessment tool that tracks data like heat vulnerability, locations of flood zones, locations of previously flooded areas and electrical outages, and areas of heavy tree damage from different departments and utilities, recognizing interdependencies between city departments. Keeping with the theme of coordination and collaboration, the report underpinned the creation of the cross-sectoral Resilient City Working Group (RCWG), made up of 16 city organizations, plus several outside agencies, including utilities and transit agencies. Collectively these organizations work to develop and support a broad range of new actions to address climate change impacts on infrastructure, services, and city operations in a coordinated and cohesive way to ensure that Toronto is prepared for and capable of adapting nimbly to the effects of climate change.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

            November 2016        Rio de Janeiro engaged citizens, municipal employees, and private stakeholders in creating its resilience strategy, identifying climate shocks in the city, and creating targeted measures to reduce the impacts.Climate impacts, such as strong winds and rain, sea level rise, and flooding, combined with increased heat waves and heat islands, threaten Rio de Janeiro’s residents and infrastructure. The Rio Resilience Strategy serves as a guiding document for how, in both the short and long term, the city can protect itself from these challenges and transform into a global leader in urban resilience measures.The Rio Resilience Strategy was born in 2016 as a guide for Rio de Janeiro to become a global leader in resilience by 2035. Developed with the support of a group of sector-specific experts, interviews with 39 city departments, and workshops with private sector stakeholders, the strategy defines six key goals: understand and mitigate the impacts of severe weather; cultivate green, cool, and safe urban spaces; provide high-quality basic services to all citizens; promote a circular and low-carbon economy; and increase the overall resilience and cohesion of the city and its people. The specific actions that will help Rio de Janeiro achieve these goals address flooding, drought, lack of access to clean water, and securing a safer supply of energy by decreasing dependence on hydropower. The city hopes that this strategy, underpinned by targeted stakeholder engagement, will serve as a necessary intermediary between the city’s short-term goals, as set forth in the Strategic Plan 2017-2020, and long-term roadmap, Vision Rio 500.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

            November 2016        The Chinese megacity Wuhan launched a 15-year program using green and blue sponge projects to prepare for increased waterlogging caused by rapid urbanization and natural disasters.Rapid urbanization and industrial development in Wuhan has increased the city’s impermeable area, causing flooding, pollution, and, at the same time, over-consumption of existing water supplies. By increasing the ability to absorb rainfall and improving the quality of the urban water system, the Wuhan Sponge City Programme is preparing the city for growth and extreme weather events.The Wuhan Sponge City Programme focuses on reducing waterlogging and increasing water quality via the ecological remediation of existing urban water systems and the construction of blue and green spaces to capture and store rainwater. The first phase of the project, from 2015 to 2017, will see the development of 389 so-called sponge projects, such as urban gardens and waterbodies in parks, roads, residential communities, and commercial and public buildings. These will cover 38 m2 of the city and provide habitat for plants and wildlife. By the end of the pilot period, two new rainwater pump stations will have been constructed, providing at least 25% of the city’s water. Furthermore, 13 ports and channels will be repaired, drain pipelines will be improved, and at least one lake will be ecologically restored. Overall, the project is expected to reduce the occurrence of severe waterlogging events from once annually to once in 10 years in the pilot zone, a strong start to adapting the city to climate change.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

            November 2016        Addressing the risk of rising sea levels, New York City implemented its Raise Shorelines Citywide project, which, through a comprehensive analysis of its coastlines, is protecting inhabitants and their livelihoods.Between 1900 and 2000, sea levels in New York Harbor rose by an average of just over two and a half centimeters per decade, about twice the global average, with projections showing these trends will continue or accelerate. As part of Raise Shorelines Citywide, New York City is working proactively to secure critical assets, infrastructure, and neighborhoods, addressing the risks presented by sea level rise.Raise Shorelines Citywide began in 2014, a project specifically designed to address sea level rise rather than storm surge. New York City is identifying vulnerable shorelines with comprehensive and detailed analyses, including data on daily high tide inundation, calculated using localized sea level rise projections from the New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) and a wave atlas produced specifically for this project. Using the 90th percentile of projections for the 2050s produced by NPCC, projects were identified that will fortify vulnerable stretches of shoreline to prevent inundation of buildings and infrastructure in a future where the highest average level of the New York Harbor could rise by 81 cm. Analysis of New York City’s more than 965 km of shoreline led to the selection of 15 projects that will make the city’s coastline more resilient to the risks posed by sea level rise.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

            November 2016        Mexico City is redefining its streetscape by improving drainage conditions, adding green infrastructure, and ensuring that key city spaces are safe and attractive for pedestrians, cyclists, and public transit users.Faced with increased instances of flooding and extreme heat, the Mexican mega-city is combining smart climate adaptation with urban planning improvements in an effort to not only improve drainage and mitigate heat, but also ensure that streets, transit corridors, and public spaces are safe and inviting.In 2016, Mexico City launched a “complete streets” initiative, dubbed Calle Verde, in an effort to improve drainage, add green spaces, and cultivate a safer and more attractive streetscape that caters to the needs of pedestrians, cyclists, and public transit users while better preparing the city for the effects of climate change. Consisting of both grey and green interventions, the program will repair drainage pipes under key corridors and repave streets and sidewalks with permeable pavement in order to prevent flooding during extreme weather events. Furthermore, corner extensions at intersections will improve pedestrian safety, and planting trees and green spaces will help the city manage rainwater, mitigate urban heat island effects, and serve as attractive public spaces. The project is financed by the city’s bus rapid transit system, Metrobus, and aligns with the objectives of the larger, city-wide Comprehensive Mobility Program. As such, the project takes care to ensure that these newly renovated and redesigned streets are accessible and well-connected by adding and improving existing bicycle paths and integrating transit lines along these corridors.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Cities100: New York City - Resilience Study Prepares Communities for Future Flooding
#################################################################################

            November 2016        New York City has conducted comprehensive studies over areas at risk of flooding due to climate change, increasing the resilience of buildings and livelihoods.Hurricane Sandy demonstrated that New York City is highly at risk from coastal storms, and climate change and sea level rise will only increase this risk in the future. To respond to these concerns, the New York City Department of City Planning has completed a coastal risk assessment, taking into account the impact of flooding from sea level rise and changes in weather patterns, resulting in changes to zoning regulations, and securing resilient neighborhoods for the future.New York City’s Resilient Neighborhoods Study was launched in 2013 as a way to develop locally tailored strategies for land use and zoning changes that are responsive to the coastal hazards the city faces now and in the future. Ten studies were completed across a range of coastal neighborhoods in the city which analyzed damage from Hurricane Sandy; risks from coastal storms, including 10-, 50-, and 100-year storms; flood elevations; wave threats; future floodplains; and sea level rise. Information from these studies will help shape how and where development occurs on vulnerable coastal land and protect the 71,500 buildings currently located along these shorelines. In addition, the city is producing a web-based mapping tool for each study area, informing property owners about the current and future flood risks in their neighborhood, and enabling them to make better investments in resilient infrastructure. The city hopes the recommendations created from this study will influence the future growth and development of these 10 neighborhoods, as well as districts across New York City’s 837 km of coastline that are at risk from flooding and sea level rise.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

            November 2016        Revitalizing school lots to capture stormwater reduces the risk of flooding in Chicago’s poorest neighborhoods, while fostering community engagement.With climate change causing new rainfall patterns, flooding risks for poor communities have increased to new levels. In the last eight years, the city has experienced four storms exceeding the rainfall amount of a “10-year-storm.” Space to Grow mitigates the problem by providing green infrastructure to soak up stormwater.Launched in 2013, Space to Grow has revolutionized everyday asphalt school lots into green stormwater infrastructure playgrounds that serve as educational amenities and community gathering spaces. The project targets low-income areas facing flood risks as well as social and economic challenges. The design focuses on capturing stormwater, with the city’s current infrastructure unable to withstand the new rainfall patterns caused by climate change. By redesigning playgrounds, the project aims to reduce flood risk in the surrounding school neighborhoods, each designed to manage a 24-hour, 100-year storm, exceeding requirements in Chicago’s Stormwater Management Ordinance. At the same time, outdoor classrooms, vegetable gardens, and sporting facilities promote environmental education, social engagement, and physical activity. Access is provided to families and the community outside school hours, fully utilizing the new spaces. Overall, six school lots have been transformed by Space to Grow and 28 more are expected to be completed by 2019.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

            November 2016        With Sub-Saharan Africa’s first renewable energy-powered light-rail train network, Addis Ababa is leading a modal shift for urban public transport on the continent.Transportation accounts for 47% of the CO₂ emissions in Addis Ababa. The renewable energy-powered LRT reduces greenhouse gas emissions while bringing clean and efficient transportation to city dwellers.In September 2015, Addis Ababa inaugurated Sub-Saharan Africa’s first lightrail train (LRT). The LRT, an inner-city tram, can carry up to 60,000 people per hour, and after 10 months of operation, ridership has reached 15,000 passengers per hour in each direction. The train is powered by Ethiopia’s power grid, which is fueled almost exclusively by hydropower, geothermal, and wind power. Emissions reductions from the project are estimated to grow from 55,000 tons of CO₂ per year in 2015 to 170,000 tons CO₂ per year by 2030. The more efficient mode of transportation is expected to stimulate the local economy and attract new investments and will become a blueprint for local expansion and regional replication. The project is the fruit of an international multi-stakeholder collaboration that involved different levels of the Ethiopian government, foreign banks, and the Chinese government. It is also an important tenet of the Addis Ababa Climate Resilient Growth Economy plan to drive the transition to a green economy.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Through its biogas-to-energy project, Johannesburg is mitigating those impacts while also reducing methane emissions and turning waste into a productive resource.In 2011, Johannesburg launched a project to transform methane emissions from wastewater and landfill waste into energy. The project currently supplies 1.1 MW of electricity to the Northern Water Treatment plant, the largest in the city, which is equivalent to 12% of the plant’s operational needs. The city plans to expand the project to four other wastewater plants. In addition, to further scale up this solution, Johannesburg will partner with an energy management services company to develop biodigestors that will process organic waste from the city’s five landfills, turning it into biogas used to fuel the city’s bus fleet. Recognized as a Clean Development Mechanism project by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, this initiative is the result of a public-private partnership wherein the city provides the rights to the landfill gas to the developer, who is responsible for financing and operating the project. This arrangement enables the city to undertake the project risk-free while receiving royalties from the developer.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>In its second year, Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2016 publication online

Overview of Wuhan pedestrian & cycling and greenway systems planning
#################################################################################

            October 2016        In terms of scale, the network density of the pedestrian & cycling system and right of way are to be fully guaranteed in order to prevent any decrease in existing scale and space given over to the pedestrian & cycling system. Both space for the pedestrian & cycling system, and for vehicles will expand simultaneously on new roads.Travel mode objectives: In the travel mode mix, green transport such as walking, cycling, and public transport shall reach 80%, in which cycling shall not be less than 20% (16% of all traffic modes). At terminal of rail transport, cycling shall take up 15~20% of all traffic modes.The main contents of the plan include:  “Metro public transport + pedestrian & cycling”, “vehicle use reduction” and “holistic street” strategies, along with district-specific and traffic network-specific measures, together with an increase in density of the pedestrian & cycling network. In the main city zones, 2,455km of non-vehicle lane network has been built with four different levels. For each level, the modality of separation and the width requirements have been specified.Vehicle/non-vehicle physical segregation was recommended so that cyclists can enjoy a guaranteed safe section of 1,141 km, an increase of nearly 300% on the present.

Wuhan's ‘building a green transport city’ pilot programme
#################################################################################

            June 2016        In terms of organisation and management regulations, a steering panel for the construction of a green and low carbon mobility city was set up in order to coordinate the pilot. The panel’s role was also to draft an implementation plan for the construction of Wuhan’s green and low carbon mobility system regional programme, as well as the provisional management rules governing the special fund for Wuhan’s green and low carbon mobility system regional programme.Regarding the prevention and control of air pollution, the old, high pollution “yellow-label” buses and commercial “yellow label” passenger cars have been taken out of operation.  During the execution of the programme, by December 2015, 2.75 billion RMB had been invested into the construction of Wuhan’s green and low carbon mobility system regional programme. An amount of 3.4 kiloton/year standard coal equivalent has been saved, and 171 kilotons/year of standard fuel equivalent has been substituted.In the meantime, clean energy vehicles using liquefied natural gas or compressed natural gas are now promoted in the mobility industry. Between 2013 and 2015, more than 1,169 CNG buses were purchased. The average unit of CNG consumption is 45 m3/100km, and yearly oil substitution is 31.0293 kilotons of fuel equivalent. In 2013, 12,499 taxis were retrofitted to use CNG, with CNG consumption around 100.09 million m3/year and fuel substitution of 85.0765 kilotons of fuel equivalent. Between 2013 and 2015, 48 LNG traction engines were purchased, with an annual fuel substitution of 4,285 tons of fuel equivalent. Besides this, two hybrid fuel power vessels were constructed and commissioned at the Yangtze River.The use of ‘new energy’ vehicles was promoted in public transport, passenger transport, and freight transport. By 2015, more than 1,000 ‘new energy’ buses, 465 electric taxis and 113 ‘new energy’ logistics trucks had been put in operation.

            April 2016        <strong>Summary</strong>The extension of similar systems will be an important focus of policy in Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management in the coming years.<strong>What is it?</strong><strong>How does it work?</strong>In 2011, the two pilot areas (Gazi and Kypriadou area) were selected based on various parameters such as infrastructure, population density and transportation costs. Public awareness campaigns were then launched so as to increase the active participation of residents. The implementation of the project in the two pilot areas was initiated in October 2013 and included the distribution of 2,200 biowaste collection bins. Until the end of 2013, 46 tonnes of biowaste were collected, increasing to 260 tonnes by 2014. Due to the success of the project, biowaste collection continues with the City’s own funds. The City has decided to expand the project to cover all of Athens.<a href="https://www.c40.org/wp-content/static/other_uploads/images/596_Athens2.original.png?1460459577" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA0MzMgMzI1IiB3aWR0aD0iNDMzIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjMyNSIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkY1OTZfQXRoZW5zMi5vcmlnaW5hbC5wbmclM0YxNDYwNDU5NTc3IiBkYXRhLXc9IjQzMyIgZGF0YS1oPSIzMjUiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/></a><strong>CO<sub>2 </sub>Reduction </strong><strong>Application</strong>The biowaste collection at the source has significantly reduced operational costs related to the avoidance of the 45euro/ton landfill fee for the biowaste collected, as well as the reduction in fuel consumption due to optimization of the waste collection system.Another benefit is related to citizen engagement. During the ATHENS BIOWASTE project, the intensive awareness raising activities in the two pilot areas reduced impurities in the biowaste collected. As such, the success of the ATHENS BIOWASTE programme and the experience gained can be used to improve Solid Waste Management (SWM) in the City for other municipal waste streams as well.The City of Athens has also reached out to other organizations for the collection of biowaste and has shared its project experience with other neighboring municipalities in the Attica Region.The City of Athens has actively collaborated for the expansion of biowaste collection with:1. The Ministry of National Defense:i) The Officers’ Restaurant of armed forces of the Ministry of National Defenseii) The kitchen facilities of two major military hospitalsiii) The kitchen facilities of the Air Force General Staff and the Hellenic Navy General Staff2.

            February 2016        Curitiba was the first city to develop Bus Rapid Transit in 1974 and today the city continues to be a transit innovator, having recently launched a program to implement hybrid and electric buses. Curitiba’s BRT system was developed as an integral part of an overall Masterplan (1966),In the 1990s, after creating the BRT system thanks to a partnership between the municipality and bus operators (which made the first BRT lanes cost 50 times less than subwayToday, 80% of travellers use the BRT system and it carries around 2 million passengers per day.The success of the BRT system is related to its integration in Curitiba’s masterplanning and support from different stakeholders. On the micro level, some employers subsidise their employees who use the BRT system. On the macro level, urban planning is integrated with the BRT system, with urban growth being restricted to corridors of growth – along key transport routes – using a combination of control and incentives, such as extended permitting for developers that wish to construct taller buildings close to the transit corridors.Cities developing or updating urban development plans, planning for upgrade of their transport system or looking into implementing a BRT system, can all use this approach to ensure that different transport modes are well integrated and constitute the most efficient system possible. C40's The Bus Rapid Transit Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

Amsterdam developed an open-source Energy Atlas to provide detailed information on the geographical distribution of energy demand and potential supply (thermal production, geothermal, industry and private buildings’ waste heat) and a basis for local energy strategies; to enable implementation of the right combination of measures and technologies based on scenario modelling; and to help build the business case for district heating, cooling and power.Amsterdam launched its Energy AtlasUsing the Energy Atlas has already enabled Amsterdam to transform Zuidoost, an existing 300-hectare mixed-use area, and to establish cooperation among various industrial partners on the exchange of energy and the use of excess waste heat from data centres. Amsterdam is currently replicating the positive experience from Zuidoost in order to advance district energy opportunities in other communities.The success of Amsterdam’s energy mapping was based on strong regulatory framework (i.e. district-connection targets and a connection mandate for all new developments); partnership with other utility providers (e.g. the water network), city monitoring departments and developers on sharing data (driven by partners’ demand for the energy utility data once project finished); and public support driven by demand for open-source data that could facilitate cooperation between stakeholders on saving energy and financial resources. C40's The District Energy Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

#################################################################################

            February 2016        Transport for London (TfL – the transport authority for London) has developed a tool that rates the accessibility of locations across London to public transport, informing reduced parking standards in highly accessible areas. The Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) method assesses the level of walking distances to transport stops and stations, including measuring the level of transport service and wider connectivity.The PTAL scoring allows the Greater London Authority (GLA – the authority responsible for urban planning in London) to understand accessibility to public transport across the whole of London, and accordingly permit developers to reduce private vehicle provision at accessible locations. The PTAL score allows planners to identify TOD-appropriate areas and plan accordingly.PTAL is a citywide rating tool that is clear and transparent in its methodology. By making accessibility data available, PTAL enables planners to reduce minimum parking requirements in high-scoring areas close to public transport and plan appropriately for density.Cities looking to reduce parking provision and increase developable space might use the PTAL methodology to identify areas highly accessible to public transport to inform parking provision standards. C40's The Transit Oriented Development Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

            February 2016        To facilitate achievement of its goal of having 25% of energy supplied by decentralized sources by 2025, the Greater London Authority developed the Decentralised Energy Master Planning (DEMaP) district energy programme, which ran from 2008-2010, with funding of €3.3 million (US$3.7 million). It focused on identifying opportunities for district heating networks through heat mapping and energy masterplanning as well as building capacity within local authorities to deliver district energy projects and develop planning policies that encourage, and where appropriate require, district energy in new developments. The main output of the programme was the London Heat MapThe London Heat Map is an interactive GIS tool that allows users to identify opportunities for decentralised energy projects in London. The Heat Map provides spatial intelligence on factors relevant to the identification and development of district energy opportunities, such as: location of major energy consumers, local and city-wide fuel consumption and COBased on opportunities identified through the London Heat Map, London is already developing a number of district heating projects, such as the Lee Valley Heat Network, which aims to provide over 5,000 homes with required heating and hot water through harnessing waste heat sourced from a nearby EcoPark. On the city-level, London has continued with the Decentralised Energy for London programme, providing assistance for commercialisation of large decentralised energy projects, primarily looking at district heating schemes supplied from CHP and waste heat.The success of London’s energy mapping approach is based on the city’s rich planning and monitoring experience, as well as availability of multiple communication platforms that facilitate reporting from building owners and public disclosure.Comprehensive energy mapping, although often cost and planning intensive, is a crucial stepping-stone for city-wide development of district energy systems. It provides a critical overview of demand and supply to help guide district energy network prioritisation and maximise renewable energy – like waste heat and free cooling – sources. For cities that have recently started district energy planning, energy mapping provides multiple benefits, from comprehensive information to establishment of initial relationships with building owners during information gathering, which might facilitate later development of district systems. Cities that are hoping to support other local and regional authorities to pursue district energy systems will find energy mapping to be an important enabling tool. C40's The District Energy Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

C40 Good Practice Guides: Vancouver - South East False Creek Neighbourhood
#################################################################################

            February 2016        In 2010, Vancouver created the South East False Creek Neighbourhood Energy Utility (SEFC NEU),When the system became operational in 2010, the municipality controlled 17% of the initial system load (25% of the floor area), but it was able to pass a service-area bylaw to guarantee connection of the additional loads. The network is publicly owned, which allows for transparent connection costs and energy tariffs, enabling the city to provide information on tariff cost and savings comparisons to building owners (e.g. savings from not having on-site boilers). This helped to build confidence and encouraged new connections from residents and private developers. The total cost of the project (CAD$32 million, i.e. US$31 million) was fully covered through utility customer rates and the utility was entirely financed by city-raised debt; however, the debt was structured as if the project was financed by 60% debt and 40% equity to demonstrate commercial viability to the private sector and give the city the option to divest in the future without impacts on customer tariffs. The SEFC system has grown its customer base by 260% since 2010. The SEFC’s district heating network, conceived as a demonstration project, motivated the private development of an additional network, as well as plans for two legacy steam-heat systems’ conversion from natural gas to renewable sources. Today, most of the new district energy investment in Vancouver is coming from the private sector, typically via a franchise agreement with the city to secure low carbon outcomes. Vancouver was able to adopt the “wholly public” model thanks to its strong access to low-cost finance and its ability to secure grants, which enabled it to implement the project without initial private investment and gave it the opportunity to carry out an innovative demonstration project that could be later replicated by private developers. The impending 2010 Winter Olympics also assured broader municipal backing for the project and its “wholly public” approach as the best way to guarantee successful delivery. C40's The District Energy Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

#################################################################################

            February 2016        To facilitate achievement of its goal of having 25% of energy supplied by decentralized sources by 2025, the Greater London Authority developed the Decentralised Energy Master Planning (DEMaP) district energy programme, which ran from 2008-2010, with funding of €3.3 million (US$3.7 million). It focused on identifying opportunities for district heating networks through heat mapping and energy masterplanning as well as building capacity within local authorities to deliver district energy projects and develop planning policies that encourage, and where appropriate require, district energy in new developments. The main output of the programme was the London Heat MapThe London Heat Map is an interactive GIS tool that allows users to identify opportunities for decentralised energy projects in London. The Heat Map provides spatial intelligence on factors relevant to the identification and development of district energy opportunities, such as: location of major energy consumers, local and city-wide fuel consumption and COBased on opportunities identified through the London Heat Map, London is already developing a number of district heating projects, such as the Lee Valley Heat Network, which aims to provide over 5,000 homes with required heating and hot water through harnessing waste heat sourced from a nearby EcoPark. On the city-level, London has continued with the Decentralised Energy for London programme, providing assistance for commercialisation of large decentralised energy projects, primarily looking at district heating schemes supplied from CHP and waste heat.The success of London’s energy mapping approach is based on the city’s rich planning and monitoring experience, as well as availability of multiple communication platforms that facilitate reporting from building owners and public disclosure.Comprehensive energy mapping, although often cost and planning intensive, is a crucial stepping-stone for city-wide development of district energy systems. It provides a critical overview of demand and supply to help guide district energy network prioritisation and maximise renewable energy – like waste heat and free cooling – sources. For cities that have recently started district energy planning, energy mapping provides multiple benefits, from comprehensive information to establishment of initial relationships with building owners during information gathering, which might facilitate later development of district systems. Cities that are hoping to support other local and regional authorities to pursue district energy systems will find energy mapping to be an important enabling tool. C40's The District Energy Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

C40 Good Practice Guides: Vancouver - South East False Creek Neighbourhood
#################################################################################

            February 2016        In 2010, Vancouver created the South East False Creek Neighbourhood Energy Utility (SEFC NEU),When the system became operational in 2010, the municipality controlled 17% of the initial system load (25% of the floor area), but it was able to pass a service-area bylaw to guarantee connection of the additional loads. The network is publicly owned, which allows for transparent connection costs and energy tariffs, enabling the city to provide information on tariff cost and savings comparisons to building owners (e.g. savings from not having on-site boilers). This helped to build confidence and encouraged new connections from residents and private developers. The total cost of the project (CAD$32 million, i.e. US$31 million) was fully covered through utility customer rates and the utility was entirely financed by city-raised debt; however, the debt was structured as if the project was financed by 60% debt and 40% equity to demonstrate commercial viability to the private sector and give the city the option to divest in the future without impacts on customer tariffs. The SEFC system has grown its customer base by 260% since 2010. The SEFC’s district heating network, conceived as a demonstration project, motivated the private development of an additional network, as well as plans for two legacy steam-heat systems’ conversion from natural gas to renewable sources. Today, most of the new district energy investment in Vancouver is coming from the private sector, typically via a franchise agreement with the city to secure low carbon outcomes. Vancouver was able to adopt the “wholly public” model thanks to its strong access to low-cost finance and its ability to secure grants, which enabled it to implement the project without initial private investment and gave it the opportunity to carry out an innovative demonstration project that could be later replicated by private developers. The impending 2010 Winter Olympics also assured broader municipal backing for the project and its “wholly public” approach as the best way to guarantee successful delivery. C40's The District Energy Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

            February 2016        In Toronto, the “hybrid public-private” business model served as the catalyst for implementing the city’s deep-lake-water cooling system, planned since the early 1980s but challenged by lack of major private investment. The opportunity came when too much silt in drinking water extracted from Lake Ontario led the city to plan for a deeper, longer pipe to reduce filtering costs. Such a pipe, reaching the depths of the lake with stable low temperatures (4°C), could also serve for the deep-water cooling system. This created an incentive for the city to partner with the company Enwave through restructuring of the originally non-profit publicly owned Toronto District Heating Corporation that had restricted powers in securing long-term financing.Enwave’s Deep Lake Water CoolingOverall, the public-private partnership helped the long-planned project to reduce risk and secure financing. First, the partnership helped uncover the total benefits to the city, such as financial and environmental savings, which enabled the regulators to grant Enwave an exemption from water extraction fees (in particular as Enwave only extracts the cold from the water, not the resource itself), which was key for ensuring project’s commercial viability. Second, the partnership helped develop a customer base, as the local government backing and awareness-raising about district cooling benefits contributed to increased confidence among potential customers and their signing of the required long-term contracts (some of nearly 20 years).The success of the private-public partnership was driven by an early recognition of opportunity for partnership through connection of the drinking water and water for cooling supply. The involvement of the City of Toronto as investor and promoter helped create confidence in the project. The adaptation of local regulations (i.e. exemption from water extraction fees) also helped ensure the project’s viability, while securing long-term benefits for the City of Toronto as well as revenues from the project’s later privatization.Based on the city characteristics, including regulatory powers, financing capacity, risk tolerance and the degree of access to low-cost finance, the city can choose the right ownership structure and business model. The wholly public model is particularly suitable for cities with strong financing capability, whereas the hybrid public-private and wholly private models enable cities to leverage private investments with lower risk to the municipal government, while keeping a certain degree of involvement in or oversight of the project. C40's The District Energy Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

            February 2016        Responding to a low level of awareness, confidence, and understanding of LEVs, and aiming to spur development of an urban electric vehicle market, Shanghai established an EV Demonstration Zone. This zone is devoted to helping individuals understand how and why LEVs are a viable option for transportation, with a variety of important benefits. This is helping overcome existing barriers to LEV adoption. Under an agreement with LEV manufacturers, up to 160 vehicles of different types are available for test-drives at the Zone, along with educational programming, one-on-one interviews, and outreach. Data and feedback provided by visitors is then relayed to manufacturers and other stakeholders to elicit more specific and strategic promotional initiatives that directly address the concerns of potential buyers and Shanghai residents.The EV Zone has already provided up to 80,000 free test-drives, along with an established fleet of 160 cars from which it acquires performance and usage data. The Zone has plans to expand into the Pudong region in the near future.The Zone is dedicated to establishing strong integration of LEVs and people’s lives in the city through direct and interpersonal interactions that cater to the specific needs and concerns of visitors to the Zone. The usage data collection strategy has led to significant achievements in educating drivers about the links between their daily usage patterns and the benefits of purchasing LEVs, popularising the free test-driving opportunities the Zone provides city residents.Cities where purchasing LEVs is viable, even under early market conditions, or that have potential for significant presence of the LEV industry can look towards the Demonstration Zone as an option for integrating production, awareness raising, and adoption of LEVs.C40's The Creditworthiness Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

            February 2016        The City of Copenhagen has adopted an innovative public-private finance scheme to fund its Cloudburst Management Plan for storm water managementThe main stormwater runoff infrastructure (underground storage, drainage system) is financed through collected water charges by publicly owned water utility companies, with fees controlled and regulated by the local government. The greening component linked to improvement of public space is paid for by the local government, primarily through collected taxes, but new sources of finance might become available as Copenhagen is also lobbying the national government for a change in legislation. The remaining challenge is the finance of adaptation measures in privately owned buildings, which have the biggest potential to reduce damages from storm flooding (about one-third of costs estimated by the Cloudburst Plan) but few incentives beyond higher insurance prices.Holistic stakeholder engagement is one of the main drivers of the successful planning and implementation of the Cloudburst Management Plan. Copenhagen was able to collaborate successfully with their national government to change legislation allowing for a wider application of water fees, while also working with the Danish water utility to coordinate government and water services. Copenhagen also worked with various private- sector partners, including insurance companies, to monetise losses and projected losses and create cost-benefit analyses of various measures in order to provide a strong rationale for significant budgetary allocation.Cities around the world should in particular consider priority budgeting, adaptation pathways and creative finance when a complete climate change adaptation plan’s financial needs are larger than the amount available within the city budget and other funding sources are limited or lacking.C40's The Climate Change Adaptation in Delta Cities Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

            February 2016        Shenzhen pioneered an innovative business model, successfully mobilising vehicle manufacturers, grid companies, bus and taxi operators, policy research institutes and citizens to promote its New Energy Vehicles (NEVs) Plan in 2009 (NEVs include electric, hybrid and fuel cell vehicles). Since then, the city’s strategy has been to prioritise electrified public transportation (buses and taxis), and then gradually transition private cars to NEVs as well. This project has set two main goals: a short-term goal of adding 35,000 NEVs in the next two years, and a long-term goal of reaching a zero-emission ecosystem.The project has already shown substantial results. The NEV fleet has enabled Shenzhen to reduce COIn 2009, Shenzhen was approved by the central government to be one of many cities for piloting new energy vehicle technology and infrastructure. With this support from the Chinese central government, along with commitment and actions by the regional and city level governments, a multifaceted approach to LEV development, production, and uptake was launched. By focusing on city fleets in the first instance and encouraging other sectors to gear their operations towards LEV uptake in the city through policy shifts, LEV uptake was expanded more rapidly. By recognising the importance of involving other sectors and stakeholders, including citizens, Shenzhen has been able to successfully transition to new energy vehicles across diverse markets and fleets. For example, Shenzhen provides an open platform to encourage communication between companies and organizations in related industries, spurring better relationships between public and private partners on new energy vehicles.Since cities generally have more control over their own fleets, such as buses, the uptake of LEVs in these fleets provides a major opportunity to reduce emissions and improve air quality in urban centres. Cities with influential municipal or regional governments with control over these assets can look to Shenzhen’s NEV Plan to develop an integrated approach to significantly increase LEV uptake. C40's The Low Emission Vehicles Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

#################################################################################

            February 2016        The growth in EV uptake will require, and be supported by, the provision of necessary electrical infrastructure for new developments. Koto City (a special ward located in the Tokyo Metropolis in Japan) is taking steps to make such provisions available in new buildings and major redevelopments, thereby curtailing costs that could be brought on by the need for future retrofitting. With significant construction taking place in preparation for the 2020 Olympics, city planners are anticipating urban realities several decades ahead and incorporating expectations into construction happening now and in the immediate future. City planners, policymakers, and stakeholders have recognised the preparation for a major event as an opportunity worth harnessing.Located on the waterfront of Tokyo Bay, 80% of Koto’s rapidly growing population lives in multi-unit dwellings. Approximately 70 new apartment blocks are being constructed yearly with more expected, especially with the upcoming 2020 Olympics.The city anticipated more favourable conditions for LEV uptake in the future and recognised that installing charging infrastructure would curtail retrofitting costs by simplifying the installation process, making better provision for the changing needs of its citizens, and avoiding any future disruption by accounting for future LEV uptake at the time of new construction. By seizing the opportunity that came with development for the Olympics, the city was able to incorporate provisions for long-term trends and future realities.Cities, especially those that are anticipating major urban redevelopment and new builds for a growing population and/or hosting global events, can use the approach of Koto City to new construction projects, ensuring future LEV uptake is accounted for now. In addition, cities that want to create a better environment for electric vehicles, but may not necessarily be anticipating major new development, can incorporate LEV infrastructure into planning guidelines as a requirement for all new and large-scale development to cut potential future costs.C40's The Low Emission Vehicles Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

C40 Good Practice Guides: London - Charging Zones to Promote ULEVs
#################################################################################

            February 2016        London introduced a Congestion Charge zone in 2003, aimed at reducing high traffic flow in the centre of the city. The Congestion Charge zone covers 21 square kilometres (about 8.1 square miles) and operates on weekdays between 07:00 and 18:00 where most drivers must pay a daily charge of £11.50. Full electric, hydrogen and plug-in hybrid vehicles qualify for a 100% Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV) discount, providing an incentive to own and operate these types of vehicles. This discount is complemented by a range of initiatives elsewhere in London that include free on-street parking and electric charging to encourage early adoption.Since 2008, London has operated one of Europe’s largest Low Emission Zones (LEZ). Covering the entire city, the LEZ specifies emission requirements for heavy vehicles driven in the city all year round. These requirements have gradually been strengthened by the Mayor of London to correspond with the introduction of tougher European vehicle emission standards. The daily charge for non-compliance is up to £200 a day.In 2015, the Mayor of London committed to introduce the world’s first Ultra-Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) to address London’s Nitrogen Dioxide challenge and encourage the use of cleaner vehicles. For the first time, emission standards will be set for every vehicle driven in central London, including the five million cars seen over the course of a year. These standards will be fully operational by 2020, 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, in the same area as the Congestion Charge. Smaller vehicles will be charged £12.50 a day and larger vehicles £100 a day if they do not comply. As part of the ULEZ package, the Mayor of London also set strict requirements for new buses, taxis and private hire vehicles to use ultra low emission technology and create demonstrator fleets. When combined, these specific fleets are forecast to contribute around half of the road transport emissions leading to poor air quality in the city’s centre.London now holds a higher market share of ULEVs than in the UK overall and it has seen significant decreases in airborne particulate matter, achieving European legal limits for the first time.London has taken the approach to operate two distinct schemes that address congestion and pollution in the city. Whilst many public fleets, such as taxis and buses, are exempt from the Congestion Charge, they are however covered under the ULEZ scheme. During the launch of the Congestion Charge, extra buses and routes were introduced to take advantage of the increased traffic speeds and the greater demand for public transportation. Most recently, increased road capacity is being used to transform London’s cycling infrastructure.The Congestion Charge, LEZ and upcoming ULEZ are part of a comprehensive package of measures to reduce congestion and improve air quality, as well as provide incentives, resources and opportunities for city residents and industry stakeholders to transition to cleaner and more efficient vehicles. Regular drivers to the Congestion Charge zone save over £2,900 per year by switching to a full-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle and they will also comply with the ULEZ requirements, avoiding a further £4,500 cost per year. This comprehensive approach has also provided economic opportunities, creating a positive feedback loop that has facilitated conditions for even more ambitious aspirations. Thanks to the Mayor of London’s policy, London’s iconic black taxis will benefit from an unprecedented makeover — manufacturers have since responded with a £300m investment to research and produce ultra low emission taxis.Cities that aim to alter the relative advantage of fossil fuel vehicles to make ULEV purchasing more cost effective can look towards London’s systematic zoning efforts for valuable insights. Cities may face significant challenges from private-sector stakeholders who will find it difficult to transition their activities to account for these new conditions. As such, the introduction of zones will be most effective in cities with strong relationships with other sectors to help address potential concerns, and in cities with significant power and authority to implement such a strategy effectively. Overall, initiatives to clean up the oldest vehicles whilst incentivising the latest technologies will help to ensure a balanced approach. C40's The Low Emission Vehicles Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

The car share programme consisting of all-electric vehicles also provides a pathway to overcoming market barriers for electric vehicles by getting potential consumers more comfortable with using EVs.Autolib consists of over 2,500 electric vehicles, 4,710 charging stations, and has attracted over 6.6 million trips and 178,000 individual subscribers. These milestones have in turn resulted in the reduction of 7,575 tons of COBy transforming the relationship between people and cars, and making transportation a more communal activity, the Autolib programme has paved the way to decreasing the economic and environmental burden of personal transport. At roughly 20,000 persons per square kilometre, Paris is one of the densest cities in the world – four times the density of London.The Paris Autolib programme provides a notable blueprint for how obstacles to urban LEV uptake can be overcome through partnerships with other providers.

This tool aims to assist climate adaptation decision-making in local flood prone areas by proposing an economic framework for decision-makers to compare the value communities place on occupying land subject to flooding, the cost associated with flood events and flood mitigation measures. This improves decision-makers’ ability to decide on the type and timing of flood mitigation measures. The project also produced five detailed case studies of impacted sites, two of which, Southbank and Arden-Macaulay, sit within the Melbourne municipality. Such an economic model framework can also be shared among cities and prevent the need for each of the bodies to develop their own models. Moving forward, the City of Melbourne is further developing the framework into an Integrated Climate Adaptation Model, addressing both water and heat and looking at increasing community participation in all aspects of adaptation planning, much as they engage citizens in participatory budgeting in Melbourne.This project focused on developing stronger partnerships between the responsible authorities. Councils, State Government agencies and State Government departments have each learned about how to work efficiently together in the future and though limitations in the research and methodology were identified, Melbourne and the other partners emerged with a framework for inter-regional decision-making in climate change adaptation. C40's The Climate Change Adaptation in Delta Cities Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

            February 2016        New York City (NYC), situated in the delta of the Hudson River, is prone to storm flooding and sea-level rise that is exacerbated by the loss and degradation of its wetlands, which provide natural absorptive and flood defence capacityMitigation banking addresses the sub-optimal and ad-hoc current system of mitigation by developers in New York that are seeking to build on or near wetland and aquatic resources. This ad-hoc system requires developers to negotiate with resource agencies to find, restore or create aquatic resources in-kind. This requirement often results in wetland restorations that are less cost-effective, efficient and environmentally desirable. Through mitigation banking programs, a third-party entity performs wetland restoration in offsite, environmentally significant areas, thus generating “mitigation credits” that are sold to developers to offset the impacts of their activities. Such an approach typically enables the protection of more and more critical wetlands, thereby producing both economies of scale by reducing the cost associated with mitigation, as well as ecologies of scale by restoring larger, more ecologically diverse, and integrated wetland habitats.In the case of Saw Mill Creek marsh, the US$16.73 million publicly financed restoration project will result in a triple bottom line by providing a resiliency buffer to protect the adjacent communities against the impacts of storm-related flooding, easing the burden of permitting for resilient construction activities taking place along the waterfront, and also generating mitigation credits to help finance the project itself and catalyse future wetland restorations elsewhere in the city.New York City was able to leverage Federal disaster recovery funds to help seed the initial mitigation bank. Mitigation banking is a model already tested throughout the U.S. to balance economic initiatives with wetlands restoration. However, this effort had never before been pursued with Federal recovery funding and is rarely undertaken by a public agency to self-finance its own mitigation effort. This model will also allow the city to plan for and finance the long-term stewardship of the marshes and wetlands that will be rehabilitated. C40's The Cool Cities Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

C40 Good Practice Guides: London - Thames Estuary 2100 Plan
#################################################################################

            February 2016        London already benefits from world-class tidal flood defences. However, increasing pressures, including climate change, means that flood risk is increasingAs climate change is a significant factor in determining increases in flood risk, the Environment Agency funded major new research into this, looking at changes to fluvial flows, sea storm surges and sea level rise due to thermal expansion and polar ice melt. In total, the modelling took up one year’s capacity of the Met Office supercomputer. Key findings were: storm surge tides on the Thames are less likely than previously thought to increase in either height or number, due to climate change, over the next 100 years; fluvial flood flows on the river Thames could rise by about 40% by 2080, driven by increased rainfall; sea levels could rise by up to 88 cm by the end of the century, and greater increases are feasible.The plan is a flexible and adaptable solution to increasing flood risk in London and the Thames estuary. It avoids committing to flood defence infrastructure which may either prove unnecessary, due to lower than predicted sea-level rise, or be made quickly redundant, by accelerations in climate change impacts. This innovative approach to ‘planning for uncertainty’, allows for flood risk management measures to be developed in a timely, sustainable and cost- effective way, whatever the future holds.The TE2100 plan has also driven much of the science behind the latest marine climate projections for London and the UK. Its approach has gained interest from around the world, in cities such as New York, Rotterdam, Jakarta and others, to pioneer new approaches to climate change adaptation.Although at the forefront of delta city climate change adaptation, London has recognised the need to re-evaluate its data and scenarios based on changing climate and other external conditions to keep up-to-date with new potential risks and opportunities.This practice is applicable to cities that face a combination of a number of concurring serious geophysical risks or that need to re-asses the risks and defence opportunities to keep up to date with changing climate and urban conditions. The super levee solution is also particularly suited for cities with large portions of wide riverbank area for redevelopment. C40's The Climate Change Adaptation in Delta Cities Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

SecondSince its opening, the Marina Barrage has received more than 10 million visitors and hosts more than 1,800 local and international events, including the National Day celebrations and New Year’s Eve Countdown Party. The Marina Reservoir was also the venue for the rowing and canoeing competitions of the 2010 Youth Olympic Games and also five sports competitions of the 28th South East Asian Games held in June 2015.The creation of Marina Reservoir was made possible by a 10-year massive clean-up of the Singapore River and Kallang River from 1977 to 1987, which was a result of the integrated planning and close coordination between various ministries and agencies led by the then Ministry of the Environment. Singapore adopts a holistic approach to managing its water resources, essentially overseeing the entire hydrologic cycle through one national water agency, PUB. The approach of “closing the water loop” allows Singapore to develop a diversified water supply through the Four National Taps strategy and has enabled the government to deliver an efficient, safe and sustainable water supply. The Marina Barrage is an example of an infrastructure that serves dual objectives of increasing water supply and flood control.A city might choose this approach if it has either a growing population, a diminishing or otherwise unstable water supply, or both. A city should consider this type of approach if it is facing warmer conditions or possibly drought in the city itself or elsewhere in its watershed/water sourcing system.C40's The Climate Change Adaptation in Delta Cities Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

#################################################################################

            February 2016        London, built astride the River Thames and under the tidal influence of the North Sea, is expected to keep growing from the present day population of 8.6 million to 10 million by 2031The aim of achieving greater water security will be met through a combination of actions. Firstly by reducing the demand for water through fixing leaks in the main water distribution networks, ensuring new development is water efficient, and implementing an integrated programme of retrofitting water efficient devices, installing smart water meters and raising awareness of the financial and environmental benefits of being more water efficient to encourage behaviour change among consumers. In parallel, Thames Water is working to understand the resilience of new water supply options to long-term future challenges. This involves modelling how well individual and combinations of water supply options (for example a new reservoir, desalination, etc.) respond to future challenges despite deep uncertainties about the impact of climate change, energy costs, population growth, etc. The aim is to develop an optimised portfolio of water supply options that provides the greatest resilience and environmental benefits for the best value.London recognised the economic and environmental benefits of saving water resources and implemented its household water efficiency retrofits based on a detailed cost-benefit analysis. The city also explores partnerships with a number of stakeholders, from water utility to energy efficiency service providers, to help share the efficiency retrofits’ cost. C40's The Climate Change Adaptation in Delta Cities Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

            February 2016        Jakarta, located in a lowland delta area with close to 50% below regional water level, is vulnerable to coastal and river flooding due to monsoons, sea-level rise and insufficient and faulty drainage infrastructureA set of measures are planned to minimize land subsidence, including limiting groundwater extraction, providing sufficient supply of raw water from surface water, developing water retention basins, and building absorption wells called biopores (1 million planned). The restriction on groundwater extraction, decreed by regional regulation, is a key measure for slowing down land subsidence. The Northern Jakarta area is mandated to have 100% water-supply coverage and 0% groundwater abstraction by 2015. The rest of the city will also see groundwater extraction phased out in geographic bands moving southward by 2020, 2025 and 2030, with the similar assumption that piped water will be provided in all districts by 2030. This initiative is co-financed by taxing groundwater consumption and is supported by development of alternate water supply piping for large industrial users or relocation of large groundwater users outside the ‘critical zones’, but it admittedly still faces some challenges of proper enforcement. Other initiatives include construction of East Flood Canal and interconnection canals; Jakarta Emergency Dredging InitiativeJakarta’s mitigation of land subsidence is driven by international assistance and sharing of lessons learned with other delta cities, as well as acknowledgment of the need for an integral water management approach, in which sanitation, wastewater treatment, surface water quality, alternate access to clean drinking water and flood protection are being improved in an interconnected way.This approach is particularly relevant if a city has a significant portion of land at, or already below, sea level, is highly canalized, or has high rate of groundwater extraction and the delta is no longer naturally being reinforced with sediment. C40's The Climate Change Adaptation in Delta Cities Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

            February 2016        On average, Hong Kong is affected by about six tropical cyclones between April and October each year causing extremely heavy rainfall and their duration and strength is projected to increase with climate change. The annual average rainfall is about 2,400 mm and a record high rainfall intensity of 145 mm per hour was set in 2008. During these rainstorms, urban and rural low-lying areas and natural floodplains in the northern part of the territory face the risk of flooding, with rainwater management being complicated by the high speed of runoff due to the steep terrain in Hong Kong. The Drainage Services Department of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has been addressing the threats of heavy rainfall by expanding and improving the existing drainage, pumping and storage systems through detailed hydraulic analysis of different drainage basins in the Drainage Master Plan StudiesUpon the completion of these Studies between 1994 and 2010, Hong Kong constructed four storm water drainage tunnels to intercept the runoff at uphill catchments, built 27 village polders, 3 urban underground stormwater storage schemes, 360 km of trained (directed and slowed-down) river channels, and 2,400 km of drainage pipes for effective stormwater conveyance. The Happy Valley Underground Stormwater Storage Scheme, composed of storage tanks beneath several sports fields with a capacity of 60,000 m3, is currently under construction.

C40 Good Practice Guides: Copenhagen - Cloudburst Management Plan
#################################################################################

            February 2016        Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark situated on the coast of the Øresunds region that connects the North Sea with the Baltic Sea, is vulnerable to sea level rise, warmer weather and more weather extremes in the future, including heavy rain events. Spurred by a series of highly damaging cloudburst events, including the July 2011 cloudburst that caused damages worth close to €1 billion, Copenhagen needed a better way to manage the water inundating the city during these downpours. In 2011 the City of Copenhagen adopted the Copenhagen Climate Adaptation PlanCopenhagen was able to work with water utility on a comprehensive restructuring of the Copenhagen drainage system (including separation of rainwater from waste water) and streetscape, in order to turn roads into rivers in the case of extreme rain (part of Copenhagen’s “storm water plan”) and direct water to outlets and retention basins. This is complemented by greenscaping, in particular through implementation of the Sustainable Urban Drainage System – building of green gardens, rooftops and bioswales to prevent rainwater from flowing directly into sewers.There are three main reasons for Copenhagen’s success. First, the city had experienced repeated extreme weather events, which created political buy-in for change. Second, the Copenhagen government showed budget creativity by pushing for a change in national level legislation to allow the use of revenues from a water-use fee combined with private financing and revenues from taxes for investment in the water management system. Finally, presenting the adaptation measures under the “improved city green space” frame stimulated great enthusiasm and acceptance of major city infrastructure overhaul. C40's The Climate Change Adaptation in Delta Cities Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

C40 Good Practice Guides: Jakarta - Socially Inclusive Climate Adaptation for Urban Revitalization Project
#################################################################################

            February 2016        Through the Spatial Plan 2030As part of the pilot project, the Government of Jakarta has already built 14,201 new apartment units towards the target of 52,656 units by 2017 and relocated around 50,000 people to government subsidised high-rise, low-cost housing, while not only providing them with basic amenities (electricity, water), but also taking into account their job security through an economic empowerment scheme. This allowed Jakarta to expand and deepen the Pluit Reservoir to increase its water storage capacity and develop surrounding green spaces to improve water infiltration. The project also delivers multiple co-benefits, including improved livelihood and sanitary conditions for relocated citizens, carbon sequestration and urban pollution reduction. Finally, reduced flood frequency and duration coupled with fewer people living in flood-prone areas helps prevent disease outbreaks, such as malaria and typhus.Jakarta’s success in addressing residents’ initial opposition to the project stemmed from the community multi-stakeholder approach, with leadership from the Governor, officials, private sector and community heads, as well as intensive communication and public information campaigns. These had to address the issue of residents not being accustomed to living in rented vertical housing and reluctance to relocate without compensation, fuelled by lack of knowledge about new housing’s benefits. Another reason for success was the private- public scheme, in which private companies holding property development permits in the affected area were obliged to participate in the project under a cross-subsidy scheme.A city that faces competing interests for land use and other issues causing land encroachment, such as informal settlement, where buffer areas for flood protection are needed, could adopt an approach such as the one Jakarta took. All delta cities however, should assess their coastal and riverside land-use and determine if the uses are sustainable and resilient to changing climate conditions. C40's The Climate Change Adaptation in Delta Cities Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

C40 Good Practice Guides: Ho Chi Minh City - Triple-A Strategic Planning
#################################################################################

            February 2016        Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is located in the delta area of the Saigon and Dong Nai rivers. The city’s main challenge is urban flooding due to heavy rainfall and insufficient drainage capacity, exacerbated by fast urban development occurring on low-lying marshland, higher frequency of heavy rainfall events (attributed to the urban heat island effect) and projected or already occurring sea-level rise. HCMC also suffers from salinisation of the ground and groundwater. To address these multiple climate-change related impacts, HCMC adopted its comprehensive Climate Adaptation StrategyCurrently in implementation, the Climate Adaptation Strategy divides the city into implementation zones, with on-going pilot projects in each. The pilot activities include the relocation of harbour infrastructure from the dense city area (District 4). This relocation opens space for climate adaptation measures – including improvements in the urban landscape such as parks to provide stormwater attenuation – towards the sea and onto low-lying areas (Nha Be District). These low-lying areas and the new harbour facilities on them are adapting flood proofing measures as they are located outside of planned dykes.

C40 Good Practice Guides: Rotterdam - Climate Change Adaptation Strategy
#################################################################################

            February 2016        Rotterdam, the largest European port, has an integrated climate change adaptation approach, marked by adoption of the Rotterdam Climate ProofRotterdam’s adaptation system is based on the flood and sea-level rise defence system, consisting of the Maeslantkering (flexible storm surge barrier), permanent sand dunes along the coast, and dykes along the rivers. In fact, Rotterdam adopts a tailored “inner-dyke/outer-dyke” approach. The inner-dyke city (mostly below sea level) is formed by a system of polders drained by water outlets and pumps and protected by smaller secondary dykes. The outer-dyke city area (3-5.5 m above the sea level), where about 40,000 citizens live, is vulnerable to rising sea levels or smaller temporary floods. It is being adapted through use of innovative technologies (e.g. floating buildings) and more traditional approaches (e.g. insulation of building facades and raising electrical installations). In addition to sea and river flood defence, Rotterdam is also addressing heavy rainfall threats. It has built water storage spaces, including the Museumpark car park underground water storage with capacity of 10,000 mSince the very conception of the city, Rotterdam has a history of integrating land use and flood control, with city officials and other stakeholders making decisions around water management in relation to natural conditions. The city government also clearly identifies climate change adaptation as a priority, taking responsibility for resilient planning and financing a large portion of adaptation measures. Climate change adaptation investment needs have been integrated in the city budget, which enables the city to be proactive about planning for climate change resilience. C40's The Climate Change Adaptation in Delta Cities Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

#################################################################################

            February 2016        Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is located in the delta area of the Saigon and Dong Nai rivers. The city’s main challenge is urban flooding due to heavy rainfall and insufficient drainage capacity, exacerbated by fast urban development occurring on low-lying marshland, higher frequency of heavy rainfall events (attributed to the urban heat island effect) and projected or already occurring sea-level rise. HCMC also suffers from salinisation of the ground and groundwater. To address these multiple climate-change related impacts, HCMC adopted its comprehensive Climate Adaptation StrategyCurrently in implementation, the Climate Adaptation Strategy divides the city into implementation zones, with on-going pilot projects in each. The pilot activities include the relocation of harbour infrastructure from the dense city area (District 4). This relocation opens space for climate adaptation measures – including improvements in the urban landscape such as parks to provide stormwater attenuation – towards the sea and onto low-lying areas (Nha Be District). These low-lying areas and the new harbour facilities on them are adapting flood proofing measures as they are located outside of planned dykes. The larger city-wide Strategy is being complemented by other measures, including: a mandate for all new developments to be elevated 2-2.5 m above mean sea level; a polder system to be built around the city with around 200 km of dykes and hundreds of tidal gates; and workshops on community based adaptation (early warning systems in communities and design of evacuation routes and drainage channels); in addition to on-going research by HCMC University on entire city modelling and simulations of probable flooding events.HCMC builds on experience and lessons-learned shared through cooperation with Rotterdam and through the C40 Connecting Delta Cities Network and tailors it to local geographical and political conditions.

#################################################################################

            February 2016        Through the Spatial Plan 2030As part of the pilot project, the Government of Jakarta has already built 14,201 new apartment units towards the target of 52,656 units by 2017 and relocated around 50,000 people to government subsidised high-rise, low-cost housing, while not only providing them with basic amenities (electricity, water), but also taking into account their job security through an economic empowerment scheme. This allowed Jakarta to expand and deepen the Pluit Reservoir to increase its water storage capacity and develop surrounding green spaces to improve water infiltration. The project also delivers multiple co-benefits, including improved livelihood and sanitary conditions for relocated citizens, carbon sequestration and urban pollution reduction. Finally, reduced flood frequency and duration coupled with fewer people living in flood-prone areas helps prevent disease outbreaks, such as malaria and typhus.Jakarta’s success in addressing residents’ initial opposition to the project stemmed from the community multi-stakeholder approach, with leadership from the Governor, officials, private sector and community heads, as well as intensive communication and public information campaigns. These had to address the issue of residents not being accustomed to living in rented vertical housing and reluctance to relocate without compensation, fuelled by lack of knowledge about new housing’s benefits. Another reason for success was the private- public scheme, in which private companies holding property development permits in the affected area were obliged to participate in the project under a cross-subsidy scheme.A city that faces competing interests for land use and other issues causing land encroachment, such as informal settlement, where buffer areas for flood protection are needed, could adopt an approach such as the one Jakarta took. All delta cities however, should assess their coastal and riverside land-use and determine if the uses are sustainable and resilient to changing climate conditions. C40's The Climate Change Adaptation in Delta Cities Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

Spurred by a series of highly damaging cloudburst events, including the July 2011 cloudburst that caused damages worth close to €1 billion, Copenhagen needed a better way to manage the water inundating the city during these downpours. In 2011 the City of Copenhagen adopted the Copenhagen Climate Adaptation PlanCopenhagen was able to work with water utility on a comprehensive restructuring of the Copenhagen drainage system (including separation of rainwater from waste water) and streetscape, in order to turn roads into rivers in the case of extreme rain (part of Copenhagen’s “storm water plan”) and direct water to outlets and retention basins. This is complemented by greenscaping, in particular through implementation of the Sustainable Urban Drainage System – building of green gardens, rooftops and bioswales to prevent rainwater from flowing directly into sewers.There are three main reasons for Copenhagen’s success. First, the city had experienced repeated extreme weather events, which created political buy-in for change. Second, the Copenhagen government showed budget creativity by pushing for a change in national level legislation to allow the use of revenues from a water-use fee combined with private financing and revenues from taxes for investment in the water management system. Finally, presenting the adaptation measures under the “improved city green space” frame stimulated great enthusiasm and acceptance of major city infrastructure overhaul. C40's The Climate Change Adaptation in Delta Cities Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

            February 2016        Jakarta, located in a lowland delta area with close to 50% below regional water level, is vulnerable to coastal and river flooding due to monsoons, sea-level rise and insufficient and faulty drainage infrastructureA set of measures are planned to minimize land subsidence, including limiting groundwater extraction, providing sufficient supply of raw water from surface water, developing water retention basins, and building absorption wells called biopores (1 million planned). The restriction on groundwater extraction, decreed by regional regulation, is a key measure for slowing down land subsidence. The Northern Jakarta area is mandated to have 100% water-supply coverage and 0% groundwater abstraction by 2015. The rest of the city will also see groundwater extraction phased out in geographic bands moving southward by 2020, 2025 and 2030, with the similar assumption that piped water will be provided in all districts by 2030. This initiative is co-financed by taxing groundwater consumption and is supported by development of alternate water supply piping for large industrial users or relocation of large groundwater users outside the ‘critical zones’, but it admittedly still faces some challenges of proper enforcement. Other initiatives include construction of East Flood Canal and interconnection canals; Jakarta Emergency Dredging InitiativeJakarta’s mitigation of land subsidence is driven by international assistance and sharing of lessons learned with other delta cities, as well as acknowledgment of the need for an integral water management approach, in which sanitation, wastewater treatment, surface water quality, alternate access to clean drinking water and flood protection are being improved in an interconnected way.This approach is particularly relevant if a city has a significant portion of land at, or already below, sea level, is highly canalized, or has high rate of groundwater extraction and the delta is no longer naturally being reinforced with sediment. C40's The Climate Change Adaptation in Delta Cities Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

C40 Good Practice Guides: Hong Kong - Stormwater Storage Scheme
#################################################################################

            February 2016        On average, Hong Kong is affected by about six tropical cyclones between April and October each year causing extremely heavy rainfall and their duration and strength is projected to increase with climate change. The annual average rainfall is about 2,400 mm and a record high rainfall intensity of 145 mm per hour was set in 2008. During these rainstorms, urban and rural low-lying areas and natural floodplains in the northern part of the territory face the risk of flooding, with rainwater management being complicated by the high speed of runoff due to the steep terrain in Hong Kong. The Drainage Services Department of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has been addressing the threats of heavy rainfall by expanding and improving the existing drainage, pumping and storage systems through detailed hydraulic analysis of different drainage basins in the Drainage Master Plan StudiesUpon the completion of these Studies between 1994 and 2010, Hong Kong constructed four storm water drainage tunnels to intercept the runoff at uphill catchments, built 27 village polders, 3 urban underground stormwater storage schemes, 360 km of trained (directed and slowed-down) river channels, and 2,400 km of drainage pipes for effective stormwater conveyance. The Happy Valley Underground Stormwater Storage Scheme, composed of storage tanks beneath several sports fields with a capacity of 60,000 m3, is currently under construction. The first phase of the scheme was completed in early 2015 with half of its design capacity (30,000 mWith a population of 7 million and land area of around 1,100 kmAll cities need to understand the flow of water expected during major rainfall events and the natural water catchment areas. With urban infrastructure, these natural catchment areas can be augmented or re-routed as needed, based on land-use and vulnerable populations or infrastructure characteristics. In many cases, new rainwater management infrastructures can be multi-functional – as in the case of city roads in Copenhagen or the sports fields in Hong Kong. A city that is planning major infrastructure maintenance or overhaul has a particular opportunity to employ this approach. C40's The Climate Change Adaptation in Delta Cities Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

It offers food waste audits and promotes simple measures, such as offering customers different portion sizes, measuring side dishes in cups, using leftover food for its soup of the day and menu specials, and raising staff awareness of what not to throw away.The FoodSave scheme, funded by the European Regional Development Fund, the London Waste and Recycling Board and the Mayor of London, has been run in partnership with the Sustainable Restaurant Association that delivered FoodSave for food service and hospitality businesses (including restaurants, pubs, staff canteens, hotels and cafes) and Sustain: The alliance for better food and farming that ran the project for retailers, manufacturer and wholesalers.By March 2015, the FoodSave scheme has helped around 200 of London’s small hospitality businesses better manage their food waste, reduce food waste by over 150 tonnes and divert over 1,000 tonnes of food waste from landfill (an estimated equivalent of 3,270 tCOLondon has seized the opportunity of external funding to build an innovative public-private partnership with hospitality sector representatives and individual businesses to start addressing food waste through a voluntary food waste reduction scheme, while using the project outcomes as valuable lessons to guide future citywide food waste reduction programmes.Cities having identified food and green waste as a major issue and considering it as special focus, or cities with ambitious climate change targets in general (since food waste generates significant portion of GHGs) should consider this approach, in particular to stimulate action among private actors. C40's The Waste to Resources Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

            February 2016        Rotterdam, the largest European port, has an integrated climate change adaptation approach, marked by adoption of the Rotterdam Climate ProofRotterdam’s adaptation system is based on the flood and sea-level rise defence system, consisting of the Maeslantkering (flexible storm surge barrier), permanent sand dunes along the coast, and dykes along the rivers. In fact, Rotterdam adopts a tailored “inner-dyke/outer-dyke” approach. The inner-dyke city (mostly below sea level) is formed by a system of polders drained by water outlets and pumps and protected by smaller secondary dykes. The outer-dyke city area (3-5.5 m above the sea level), where about 40,000 citizens live, is vulnerable to rising sea levels or smaller temporary floods. It is being adapted through use of innovative technologies (e.g. floating buildings) and more traditional approaches (e.g. insulation of building facades and raising electrical installations). In addition to sea and river flood defence, Rotterdam is also addressing heavy rainfall threats.

C40 Good Practice Guides: Ho Chi Minh City - Triple-A Strategic Planning
#################################################################################

            February 2016        Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is located in the delta area of the Saigon and Dong Nai rivers. The city’s main challenge is urban flooding due to heavy rainfall and insufficient drainage capacity, exacerbated by fast urban development occurring on low-lying marshland, higher frequency of heavy rainfall events (attributed to the urban heat island effect) and projected or already occurring sea-level rise. HCMC also suffers from salinisation of the ground and groundwater. To address these multiple climate-change related impacts, HCMC adopted its comprehensive Climate Adaptation StrategyCurrently in implementation, the Climate Adaptation Strategy divides the city into implementation zones, with on-going pilot projects in each. The pilot activities include the relocation of harbour infrastructure from the dense city area (District 4). This relocation opens space for climate adaptation measures – including improvements in the urban landscape such as parks to provide stormwater attenuation – towards the sea and onto low-lying areas (Nha Be District). These low-lying areas and the new harbour facilities on them are adapting flood proofing measures as they are located outside of planned dykes. The larger city-wide Strategy is being complemented by other measures, including: a mandate for all new developments to be elevated 2-2.5 m above mean sea level; a polder system to be built around the city with around 200 km of dykes and hundreds of tidal gates; and workshops on community based adaptation (early warning systems in communities and design of evacuation routes and drainage channels); in addition to on-going research by HCMC University on entire city modelling and simulations of probable flooding events.HCMC builds on experience and lessons-learned shared through cooperation with Rotterdam and through the C40 Connecting Delta Cities Network and tailors it to local geographical and political conditions. It also seizes climate change adaptation as an opportunity for new urban development and approaches the related land-use planning on a “whole-of-city” level, seeking synergies and complementarity between different redevelopment projects (e.g. District 4 – Nha Be district). HCMC also increases the Strategy’s likelihood of success by first implementing pilot projects before scaling-up the measures.A city might adopt this approach when the local administration is fully committed to addressing climate change and prepared to think “big picture” and long-term, and when there is significant political support to see implementation at a larger scale across the city. There is a great opportunity for a city to use this approach when it is developing or revising a land-use master plan/development plan or when hit by a climate-related event that has affected the city in many different areas. C40's The Climate Change Adaptation in Delta Cities Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

#################################################################################

            February 2016        Through the Spatial Plan 2030As part of the pilot project, the Government of Jakarta has already built 14,201 new apartment units towards the target of 52,656 units by 2017 and relocated around 50,000 people to government subsidised high-rise, low-cost housing, while not only providing them with basic amenities (electricity, water), but also taking into account their job security through an economic empowerment scheme. This allowed Jakarta to expand and deepen the Pluit Reservoir to increase its water storage capacity and develop surrounding green spaces to improve water infiltration. The project also delivers multiple co-benefits, including improved livelihood and sanitary conditions for relocated citizens, carbon sequestration and urban pollution reduction. Finally, reduced flood frequency and duration coupled with fewer people living in flood-prone areas helps prevent disease outbreaks, such as malaria and typhus.Jakarta’s success in addressing residents’ initial opposition to the project stemmed from the community multi-stakeholder approach, with leadership from the Governor, officials, private sector and community heads, as well as intensive communication and public information campaigns. These had to address the issue of residents not being accustomed to living in rented vertical housing and reluctance to relocate without compensation, fuelled by lack of knowledge about new housing’s benefits. Another reason for success was the private- public scheme, in which private companies holding property development permits in the affected area were obliged to participate in the project under a cross-subsidy scheme.A city that faces competing interests for land use and other issues causing land encroachment, such as informal settlement, where buffer areas for flood protection are needed, could adopt an approach such as the one Jakarta took. All delta cities however, should assess their coastal and riverside land-use and determine if the uses are sustainable and resilient to changing climate conditions. C40's The Climate Change Adaptation in Delta Cities Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

            February 2016        Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark situated on the coast of the Øresunds region that connects the North Sea with the Baltic Sea, is vulnerable to sea level rise, warmer weather and more weather extremes in the future, including heavy rain events. Spurred by a series of highly damaging cloudburst events, including the July 2011 cloudburst that caused damages worth close to €1 billion, Copenhagen needed a better way to manage the water inundating the city during these downpours. In 2011 the City of Copenhagen adopted the Copenhagen Climate Adaptation PlanCopenhagen was able to work with water utility on a comprehensive restructuring of the Copenhagen drainage system (including separation of rainwater from waste water) and streetscape, in order to turn roads into rivers in the case of extreme rain (part of Copenhagen’s “storm water plan”) and direct water to outlets and retention basins. This is complemented by greenscaping, in particular through implementation of the Sustainable Urban Drainage System – building of green gardens, rooftops and bioswales to prevent rainwater from flowing directly into sewers.There are three main reasons for Copenhagen’s success. First, the city had experienced repeated extreme weather events, which created political buy-in for change. Second, the Copenhagen government showed budget creativity by pushing for a change in national level legislation to allow the use of revenues from a water-use fee combined with private financing and revenues from taxes for investment in the water management system. Finally, presenting the adaptation measures under the “improved city green space” frame stimulated great enthusiasm and acceptance of major city infrastructure overhaul. C40's The Climate Change Adaptation in Delta Cities Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

This obliges all public purchasing offices in Berlin to take environmental criteria into consideration for their procurement, including lifecycle costs. In 2013, the “Decree on the application of regulations for environmentally-friendly purchases and order placements for deliveries, construction work and services” (VwVBU)With this administrative regulation in place, municipal bodies have become a driving force for innovation in numerous sectors by promoting the use of sustainable, energy-efficient products which have a limited lifecycle impact on the climate, the environment and public health, and which are produced under fair labour conditions. The regulation contains stringent environmental criteria, such as minimum standards taking into account lifecycle costs or direct restrictions on certain types of products procurement for office materials, office equipment, cleaning agents and cleaning services, road vehicles, large-scale events, tenders for power supplies, the planning of office buildings, and for the recycling of commercial waste.Berlin is taking an active role to contribute towards more efficient manufacturing and product design by including sustainability requirements in all government procurements.

While the Reuse Warehouse focuses on providing materials to non-profit organizations, many of the other local organizations also make materials available to individuals. By 2015, the project has diverted 3,000 tons of material from landfillConstruction and demolition (C&D) waste can represent a major contributor to a city’s waste stream, particularly in rapidly growing cities. Developing simple programs that make it easy for generators to participate in the reuse of C&D materials is essential to avoid these materials from getting mixed with general waste and subsequently becoming more difficult to recycle or reuse. Houston’s Reuse Warehouse is an exemplary implementation of a community programme that incentivises not just material reuse but also community engagement to exchange ideas and projects for increased sustainability in construction projects. C40's The Waste to Resources Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

The larger city-wide Strategy is being complemented by other measures, including: a mandate for all new developments to be elevated 2-2.5 m above mean sea level; a polder system to be built around the city with around 200 km of dykes and hundreds of tidal gates; and workshops on community based adaptation (early warning systems in communities and design of evacuation routes and drainage channels); in addition to on-going research by HCMC University on entire city modelling and simulations of probable flooding events.HCMC builds on experience and lessons-learned shared through cooperation with Rotterdam and through the C40 Connecting Delta Cities Network and tailors it to local geographical and political conditions. It also seizes climate change adaptation as an opportunity for new urban development and approaches the related land-use planning on a “whole-of-city” level, seeking synergies and complementarity between different redevelopment projects (e.g. District 4 – Nha Be district). HCMC also increases the Strategy’s likelihood of success by first implementing pilot projects before scaling-up the measures.A city might adopt this approach when the local administration is fully committed to addressing climate change and prepared to think “big picture” and long-term, and when there is significant political support to see implementation at a larger scale across the city. There is a great opportunity for a city to use this approach when it is developing or revising a land-use master plan/development plan or when hit by a climate-related event that has affected the city in many different areas. C40's The Climate Change Adaptation in Delta Cities Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

C40 Good Practice Guides: Oslo - Waste Management Strategy
#################################################################################

            February 2016        The city of Oslo has set an overall target to reduce its COIn the current Oslo’s waste management system household waste is sorted by citizens themselves into various fractions. Since 1997, paper and drink cartons have been collected by the city after separation in households, whereas glass and metal packaging are delivered by households to about 700 local collection sites around the city (in general within a radius of 300 meters). Sorting of food waste and plastic packaging at source started in October 2009, and since June 2012 all households in Oslo are included. Plastic packaging is deposited in blue bags while food waste goes in green bags. A total of 85.5 kg of food waste per person was generated in 2014, 40% of this which was separated into green bags. By making food waste visible, the system also appears to have made residents more aware of the volume of food that is wasted, as the total volume of food waste has reduced by 5% since collections started. Residual waste is discarded in other plastic bags and all bags are discarded into the same waste containers before coloured bags are separated from each other in optical sorting plants.This system required no logistical changes to the existing waste management system and could be implemented rapidly – contrary to the alternative of adding more waste containers and routes for the collection vehicles.Two waste-to-energy plants incinerate residual waste from the city, with a capacity of 410,000 tonnes of waste per year and the energy used for district heating and electricity generation. The total annual energy production is about 840 GWh heat and 160 GWh electricity. The heat energy meets the need of about 84,000 households through the district heating system, while the produced electricity is delivered to Oslo’s schools, together with electricity produced from landfill gas from the city landfill closed in 2007.In 2011, about 240,000 tonnes of household waste was collected and of this 1% was reused, 33% recycled (37% in 2014), 60% energy-recovered and only 6% went to landfill. The city aims to recycle 50% of the household waste by 2018. Currently, Oslo is drafting a new waste strategy for the 2015-2025 period with enhanced goals and a closer linking to the circular economy.Oslo has successfully built an integrated waste management system based on adaptation of a legacy waste collection system which was quickly upgraded through the use of innovative technologies. It also benefitted from early recognition of the importance of behaviour change in reducing waste generation and perfecting source separation of waste. The waste management strategy was also driven by the city’s long-term GHG emissions reduction and waste reduction goals. Oslo and Cambi AS received the Norwegian Research Council’s innovation reward in 2012 for their approach of system thinking around waste and their biogas/bio fertilizer production plant.Cities in need of implementing fast transitions in their waste systems can learn from these successful innovative technology solutions in waste separation and disposal reduction, as well as communication strategies, and citizen engagement. Cities planning long-term strategies can also follow the above examples to develop more ambitious plans. C40's The Waste to Resources Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

It offers food waste audits and promotes simple measures, such as offering customers different portion sizes, measuring side dishes in cups, using leftover food for its soup of the day and menu specials, and raising staff awareness of what not to throw away.The FoodSave scheme, funded by the European Regional Development Fund, the London Waste and Recycling Board and the Mayor of London, has been run in partnership with the Sustainable Restaurant Association that delivered FoodSave for food service and hospitality businesses (including restaurants, pubs, staff canteens, hotels and cafes) and Sustain: The alliance for better food and farming that ran the project for retailers, manufacturer and wholesalers.By March 2015, the FoodSave scheme has helped around 200 of London’s small hospitality businesses better manage their food waste, reduce food waste by over 150 tonnes and divert over 1,000 tonnes of food waste from landfill (an estimated equivalent of 3,270 tCOLondon has seized the opportunity of external funding to build an innovative public-private partnership with hospitality sector representatives and individual businesses to start addressing food waste through a voluntary food waste reduction scheme, while using the project outcomes as valuable lessons to guide future citywide food waste reduction programmes.Cities having identified food and green waste as a major issue and considering it as special focus, or cities with ambitious climate change targets in general (since food waste generates significant portion of GHGs) should consider this approach, in particular to stimulate action among private actors. C40's The Waste to Resources Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

#################################################################################

            February 2016        Rotterdam, the largest European port, has an integrated climate change adaptation approach, marked by adoption of the Rotterdam Climate ProofRotterdam’s adaptation system is based on the flood and sea-level rise defence system, consisting of the Maeslantkering (flexible storm surge barrier), permanent sand dunes along the coast, and dykes along the rivers. In fact, Rotterdam adopts a tailored “inner-dyke/outer-dyke” approach. The inner-dyke city (mostly below sea level) is formed by a system of polders drained by water outlets and pumps and protected by smaller secondary dykes. The outer-dyke city area (3-5.5 m above the sea level), where about 40,000 citizens live, is vulnerable to rising sea levels or smaller temporary floods. It is being adapted through use of innovative technologies (e.g. floating buildings) and more traditional approaches (e.g. insulation of building facades and raising electrical installations). In addition to sea and river flood defence, Rotterdam is also addressing heavy rainfall threats. It has built water storage spaces, including the Museumpark car park underground water storage with capacity of 10,000 mSince the very conception of the city, Rotterdam has a history of integrating land use and flood control, with city officials and other stakeholders making decisions around water management in relation to natural conditions. The city government also clearly identifies climate change adaptation as a priority, taking responsibility for resilient planning and financing a large portion of adaptation measures. Climate change adaptation investment needs have been integrated in the city budget, which enables the city to be proactive about planning for climate change resilience. C40's The Climate Change Adaptation in Delta Cities Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

The mixed-use space includes 46,000 square metres of offices – almost double that of the old St Giles Court – and over 100 apartments surrounding a new public square with cafes, restaurants and retail units, increasing density on the site through the introduction of 15-storey and 11-storey high buildings.The development was completed in 2010 and has since attracted major firms such as Google and Mindshare. It was also nominated in November 2010 for the London Planning Awards under the Best New Place to Live category.Central Saint Giles has succeeded in revitalising a large area in central London by investing in high-quality offices and residences but emphasising shared, public spaces at the same time. Despite the high densities achieved on the site, the buildings encircle a publicly accessible courtyard with cafes and restaurants to increase the quality of public realm. There are only ten car parking spaces due to the local planning authority insisting the development be largely car-free, with each parking space at a cost of £100,000, thereby creating a strong financial incentive to use other modes of transport.Cities redeveloping areas close to high-capacity public transport can learn from the Central Saint Giles project on how to provide densities whilst also creating high-quality public realm and reducing private vehicle use.C40's The Transit Oriented Development Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

The neighbourhood includes housing and jobs that are close to transit, and provides access to goods and services within walking distance. The development provides for a diverse range of uses, incorporating retail, offices and community facilities along with mixed-income housing. Open spaces, plazas, streets, lanes, and pathways connect the entire site and link with adjacent neighbourhoods. The Villageis designed to enhance the pedestrian and social experiences of residents and visitors through the incorporation of heritage, sustainability, and urban design.  The development was driven by ambitious sustainability and social goals. The Olympic Village is Canada's first residential, multi-unit, net-zero community – generating as much energy as it uses. The project included the rehabilitation of the shoreline, along with a new habitat island, seawall, pedestrian bridge and intertidal marine habitat. By 2020, the Olympic Village will have 5,000 residential units with a focus on affordable housing, with the dwellings complemented by a community centre on the waterfront, three childcare centres, a newly expanded library, and 26 acres of open public space.  The Olympic Village has succeeded in achieving its sustainability goals primarily because of the strong institutions and policies underpinning the development. The City of Vancouver introduced general planning principles addressing ecological, social, and economic aspects as early as 1999.  The Olympic Village project in Vancouver may be of interest to cities looking to transform former industrial areas located near the city centre and/or close to transit. The opportunities provided by the planning and organisation of a global mega-event such as the Winter Olympics in Vancouver could be leveraged by other cities staging similar large-scale events.  C40's The Transit Oriented Development Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

C40 Good Practice Guides: Stockholm - Hammarby Sjöstad
#################################################################################

            February 2016        Hammarby Sjöstad is a redevelopment project in southern Stockholm. The project was central to Stockholm’s bid to host the 2004 Olympics, with Hammarby Sjöstad part of the ecological Olympic Village. Although the bid was unsuccessful, the site has since been converted from a run-down industrial area into a modern, environmentally sustainable, mixed- use district with good public transit connections.According to ITDP, Hammarby Sjöstad is home to approximately 20,000 residents and includes nearly 100 retail units and restaurants as well as office space and light industrial uses, employing over 5,000 people. Only 21% of trips made by Hammarby Sjöstad residents are by car, while 52% are by public transportation, and 27% by bicycle or by foot. COHammarby Sjöstad’s success can be attributed to strong environmental goals that shaped the development plan, incorporating land use, building materials, energy, water and sewage, and solid waste. A transport modal shift was the main objective of the redevelopment, with the goal to create a place where 80% of trips would be made by public transport, bike or foot. This goal has been achieved by complementing expansion of the district with transport investments, including increased bus service, cycle paths, pedestrian bridges, ferry service and an extension of the tramline. Development has been focused on a dense settlement structure, concentrated along main transit corridors. In addition, to discourage car use, parking in the area is limited and expensive.Cities seeking to plan sustainability-driven large-scale redevelopment projects may be interested in following the example of Hammarby Sjöstad. It is important to note that the sustainability benefits of Hammarby Sjöstad extend beyond reducing carbon emissions to increased quality of life through the provision of nature parks and waterfront walkways. C40's The Transit Oriented Development Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

            February 2016        Singapore has introduced urban design guidelines to encourage the provision of new through-block pedestrian links and view corridors within selected developments in order to break down the scale and improve permeability of street blocks.Downtown Singapore has been planned as a pedestrian-friendly area. The city features a comprehensive network of pathways that provide convenient connections between developments, transport nodes, and key facilities. Due to strong design guidelines, the pedestrian networks have been planned for an enhanced walking experience, with the inclusion of awnings being particularly important to protect walkers from the extreme sunshine and rainfall typical to the climate of Singapore.  The provision of through-block links is guided by a set of planning parameters and urban design guidelines used to assess development proposals. In addition, further incentives are given by exempting linkages from Gross Floor Area calculations if they form part of the larger pedestrian network.  Cities with large footprint buildings might adopt through-block policies to provide more permeable urban environment and convenient walking routes, encouraging pedestrian activity. In addition, cities with inclement weather could benefit from the three-dimensional pedestrian network approach of Singapore by providing links on upper and basement levels, and covered paths for a sheltered and more comfortable experience.  C40's The Transit Oriented Development Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

            February 2016        Copenhagen is renowned for its cycling culture. Since the 1970s, the city has invested heavily in cycle infrastructure, tailoring roads and transport policy to cyclists’ needs. In 2012, the City of Copenhagen adopted a new cycling strategy for 2025 with a goal of increasing the modal share of bicycles to 50% of commuter trips and reducing serious injuries by 70%.According to the Copenhagen Bicycle Account 2014Copenhagen has been successful in its cycling strategy thanks to a range of large and small interventions to support cycling in the city. The City of Copenhagen has introduced a vast network of Green Cycle routes and Super Cycle Highways. The cycle tracks are designed with safety and convenience of the bike user in mind, with clear segregation from cars, often with a curb or trees separating the two transport users.Copenhagen’s cycling efforts have long been a source of inspiration for other cities that aspire for cycling to be the primary mode of transportation. This has given rise to the term ‘Copenhagenisation’, coined by Danish architect and professor Jan Gehl.C40's The Transit Oriented Development Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

#################################################################################

            February 2016        Founded in 2005, Stockholm's Energy CentreThe Centre’s expert support on the implementation of energy efficiency measures includes testing innovative technologies (e.g. heat recovery from ventilation and sewage water, thermal insulation, LED-lighting, etc.), introduction of energy management systems, knowledge gathering and dissemination within the city, and R&D projects. The Centre also collects critical data, including the energy mapping of all city buildings. An illustrative example is the Energy Centre’s cooperation with the Real Estate Administration. The Energy Centre financed part of the first energy audits, assisted in securing extra financing for the Real Estate Administration from the city budget of an additional €20 million for employing in-house expertise and complete the project. Around 50% of the Real Estate Administration’s building stock was targeted, which led to annual energy savings of about 30% (8 GWhDuring the first three years of the current Environment Programme the city has reduced the energy consumption by 8% and the 10% target is considered achievable. Very much due to the expert support from the Energy Centre, but above all the ambition of all relevant bodies in the city to reach the target. The 8% reduction corresponds to an accumulated cost saving of about €20 million during the three years.Stockholm recognised the importance of inter-departmental cooperation and the potential for synergies to deliver cost savings. The Energy Centre allows the city to build municipal capacity and deliver energy efficiency projects amongst its agencies without replicating efforts and processes. Central coordination of energy efficiency projects within the municipality and the potential for replication of successful projects amongst the agencies also creates greater investor confidence and helps secure additional external funding.Cities with long-term energy efficiency targets and/or a large potential for energy savings in the municipal portfolio should consider creating a specialist advisory unit to offer expert support across different municipal departments and agencies. This unit would build capacity, integrate regulations and standards and open up the opportunities to attract larger financing or develop ambitious energy savings performance contracts. C40's The Municipal Building Efficiency Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

            February 2016        Bogotá’s Zero Waste ProgramThe Zero Waste Program created a legal framework for a social inclusion plan and evolution of the established solid waste collection and disposal system into one that privileges the ‘reduce-reuse-recycle’ model, conscious consumerism, and social inclusion. The goal for 2016 is to divert at least 20% of solid waste from landfill. The social inclusion of recyclers in particular was designed to address the challenges they were facing, such as a lack of transparent organization and often violent competition between recyclers; a lack of technical training; a lack of information about their basic rights; a significant percentage facing homelessness; and cases of child labour or lack of schooling.The Zero Waste Program not only contributes to the integration of informal workforce, better waste management and waste reduction (about 1 ton/day of usable materials have been recycled), but also has multiple co-benefits, including a reduction in the cost of waste collection service by 15.23%; better health protection for recyclers through the distribution of about 12,000 protection kits in 2015 by the UAESP (City Public Service Special Administrative Unit responsible for waste management); and power generation at the Doña Juana Landfill biogas plant (39.69 MW monthly average production in 2014), which also leads to COThe project successfully used the existing informal infrastructure to build an integrated waste collection model, while providing livelihoods to local communities. It also recognized the potential and necessity of behaviour change to achieve a mature and cost-effective waste management system.Cities with an existing informal waste collection economy can adopt this approach to integrate existing infrastructure and workers at lower costs than establishing new systems. All cities should include an education and awareness-raising element to motivate behaviour change among urban citizens and help build a sustainable modern waste management/ resource valuation system. C40's The Sustainable Solid Waste Systems Good Practice Guide is available for download All references can be found in the full guide.

However, tenants are also obliged to cooperate with building owners under the scheme. A complete compliance cycle of the programme consists of the following three key elements:Each compliance cycle lasts five years. Within that period, eligible facilities report energy consumption and GHG emissions by the end of November each year. If the target is not met through internal measures, facility managers or owners will plan the procurement of external carbon credits and implement further reduction measures to ensure that they meet the target by the end of the cycle.This period lasts one and a half years, beginning from the end of the first compliance period. During this time, total actual emissions and emission allowances are confirmed. To meet emissions reduction targets, facilities owners or managers are permitted to continue trading credits until the end of the adjustment period.An Order for Action will be issued to non-compliant facilities, obliging them to reduce emissions to an amount up to 1.3 times greater than the target shortfall. If a facility does not fulfill this requirement by the deadline, they will be fined an amount of up to 500,000 yen (£2700). The facility will also have to pay the purchase price for offset credits procured by the Governor of Tokyo to cover the shortage.Data from participating facilities is currently disclosed publically online. This includes detailed facility-level information on emissions from energy and water consumption, progress towards reduction targets and details of any credit procurement or sale.Facilities demonstrating outstanding performance in emissions reduction and satisfying high standards (e.g. energy efficient design, equipment, building operations) established by the Governor of Tokyo can apply to be recognised as a ‘top-level’ facility. From April 2010 to March 2014, a total of 35 facilities have been certified as top-level, and 48 as near-top level.<strong>CO2 reduction</strong>TMG believes that the carbon trading programme has also helped stimulate the retrofit market, as indicated by; an increase in the popularity of building retrofitting technologies and techniques since the programme’s inception; an increase in the number of installations for Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS) and LED lighting; and a rise in the number of Energy Service Companies (ESCOs). In addition to this, most new buildings are designed to satisfy the requirements for a ‘top-level facility’ certification under TCTP.<strong>Next steps</strong><strong>Application</strong><strong>Further information</strong>

Copyright ©2014  </img><strong>Summary</strong><strong>What is it?</strong><strong>How does it work?</strong>Each building receives a tailored action plan that is then presented to apartment building decision makers such as executive committees, strataThe programme has also established a database consisting of energy consumption data, information on opportunities identified and progress on implementation. Initial learnings from the 30 buildings are being shared through a network of over 100 apartment buildings across the City through targeted communications and workshops.In parallel to the Smart Green Apartments programme, the City has also contributed to the creation of an online toolkit called <strong>CO2 reduction</strong>The programme has succeeded in stimulating retrofitting activity in apartment buildings either participating in or affiliated with the programme. Of all sustainability improvement recommendations made by the City to the 30 participating buildings, approximately 37% of these have been implemented. Furthermore, over 100 buildings have expressed interest in the programme to date.The City has also identified that nearly 60% of energy consumption comes from the shared portions of properties such as lighting, swimming pools, heating and ventilation systems. As lighting upgrades generate the highest return on investment within the shortest payback period (usually less than two years), many buildings have saved 20-30% of lighting costs by upgrading lighting fixtures (e.g. installation of more efficient bulbs or of motion detectors). Programme data also indicates that almost 90% of water consumption in participant buildings comes from individual apartments (40% from showering, 30% from 126 bathrooms and basins). The programme identified that sub-metering of water usage is one of the most effective measures for promoting water efficiency.<strong>Application</strong><strong>Next steps</strong><strong>Further information</strong>______________________________________________________________________________<sup>2</sup>

This programme officially began in January 2011 as a partnership between the The Challenge seeks to engage commercial property managers, building owners and office tenants in a friendly, voluntary competition that guides participants towards sustainability and greener building management, whilst recognising outstanding achievement.The areas targeted by the programme are: energy and water consumption, waste outputs, transportation, building management or tenant engagement, and employee outreach. High achievements are acknowledged through awards, media attention and official mayoral recognition.<strong>What is it?</strong><strong>How does it work?</strong>The programme welcomes participation from both tenants and property managers or building owners, with different tools and evaluation schemes employed for these groups:Another key element of the Challenge is education and support from the City, including free training and educational seminars, as well as workshops and webinars. The City also offers recommendations for improving building and office sustainability, assistance in setting up Portfolio Manager accounts, referrals to free energy audits, and financial incentives for energy efficiency retrofits from the City and local energy utilities.Outstanding performance in the programme is recognised through an awards ceremony hosted by the Mayor and the City of Houston and through extended media coverage.<strong>CO2 reduction</strong>The programme provides a great opportunity for knowledge sharing amongst participants. The City believes that this information sharing is assisting the implementation of retrofitting activities and the achievement of higher energy efficiency across buildings in Houston.

<strong>Summary</strong><strong>What is it?</strong><strong>How does it work?</strong>New construction and existing buildings undergoing major retrofits are required to comply with BEC minimum standards and requirements for four key building service installations: air-conditioning, electrical, lift and escalators and lighting.An energy audit must be conducted every ten years for the key building service installations in commercial buildings and in commercial components of composite buildings (e.g. shopping centres). The building’s energy audit report then needs to be publically displayed.  Certified REAs are required to process the BEC certification and energy audit works required under the ordinance. REAs are not necessarily third parties and may be direct staff of the developers, building owners or business tenants. Submissions from such REAs therefore function as a type of self-reporting mechanism.A six months grace period was initially given to building owners to encourage compliance with the BEEO. At this stage, the main focus of the BEEO is the prosecution and investigation of any non-compliance.<strong>CO2 reduction</strong>The results expected for the first 10 years of implementation are:Given that the BEEO was only launched in 2012, evidence for evaluating its effectiveness against national climate targets is currently limited. Nevertheless, two main impacts are expected from the programme:<strong>Application</strong>As there are more than 40,000 existing buildings in Hong Kong, reaching out to these building owners is challenging given the current resources of the BEEO enforcement team. Nevertheless, the reliance on REAs to certify the energy efficiency of buildings and to conduct energy audits has been a successful technique for dealing with this shortfall in resources.<strong>Further information</strong>______________________________________________________________________________<sup>1</sup>

            October 2015        Long defined by its oil dependence, Dubai seeks to change its reputation and position itself as a regional leader in sustainable development and green growth.Throughout the United Arab Emirates, up to 85% of the population and 90% of the infrastructure of coastal zones are at risk from climate change. Such vulnerability, combined with expected population growth, has led the city to create strategies and programs that decouple economic growth from CO2 emissions.Dubai seeks to become a regional leader in sustainable development and green growth through its Carbon Abatement Strategy (CAS) 2021. Focusing primarily on the power, water, and waste sectors, the CAS seeks to eliminate 11 million tons of CO2 by 2021. Launched in 2012, the CAS has already increased resource and system efficiency by yielding water savings of nearly 16 million m3 between 2011 and 2014, increasing the recycling rate to 10% from almost 0% in three years, and committing 48 km2 for the development of large-scale utility solar power projects.Dubai’s CO2 reduction targets may not be as ambitious as those of other cities, but they are an important step in the United Arab Emirates’ transition toward more sustainable development and a significant departure from its past. Dubai is already a global business destination and is seen by many cities in the region as a source of innovation. The CAS’s focus on green economic development, led by the Green Economy Partnerships program, which encourages green trade and investment and accelerates the adoption of green technologies, products, and services, showcases to the entire region that green growth and reduced fossil fuel dependence are economically viable and improve quality of life for citizens.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

Cities100: Wuhan - Transformation from Landfill to Garden
#################################################################################

            October 2015        The Chinese City of Wuhan has restored more than 50 hectares of land from a closed landfill in less than a year, improving the living environment for residents and solving pollution challenges.Natural degradation of pollutants from the Jinkou landfill would have taken at least 30 years, and restoration through excavation measures is very costly. To solve the issue, Wuhan restored the landfill and sur-rounding environment using aerobic ecological restoration, thereby ensuring that the land is reutilized for enjoyable purposes.The closed Jinkou landfill in Wuhan caused pollution, which natural degrada-tion would have taken decades to remove, affecting not only the environment but also residents in nearby areas. To restore this wasteland more efficiently, the city began an aerobic ecological restoration project. Not only does it alleviate risks of long-term safety issues from pollutants and eliminate the threat of methane explosions, this project also restores more than 50 hectares of land for city landscaping. Proving that even the most polluted areas can become ecological havens, this former landfill site hosted the China International Garden Expo in 2015.The restoration process, which began in 2014, introduced proper planting techniques, diverse plants, and measures to improve the soil aiming to promote continuity of the fundamental ecological system. The project ties in with Wuhan’s General Urban Planning scheme to improve the quality of the city’s ecological environment and enhance sustainable urban development, and eventually become a National Garden City, which is a title the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development grants to Chinese cities focusingon green, sustainable development.<em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

            October 2015        The Swedish capital is planning and executing impressive policies across all sectors in order to move beyond carbon neutrality and reach the goal of producing zero CO2 emissions in the next 25 years.Stockholm aims to be a true world leader as the largest city to become fossil-fuel free. In the past few years it has surpassed many of its climate change goals, proving it has the political will and technical experience necessary to achieve its ambitious target of a renewably-fueled future.In 2012, the City of Stockholm set the goal of becoming fossil fuel-free by 2050. Driven by ambitious leadership and actionable goals, in 2015, the city pushed the target date up by a decade, and now plans to run exclusively on renewable energy by 2040. The comprehensive plan relies on overall energy reduction and an increase in renewable energy use. For instance, energy standards for new buildings built on city-owned land are 55 kWh/m2 compared with national standards of 80 kWh/m2. Similarly, the city aims to reduce energy use in the building sector by 50% between 1995 and 2050.By 2040, natural gas will be entirely phased out of the city’s energy grid and heating system, replaced primarily by biogas. The energy company that provides district heating is particularly ambitious and has decided to phase out fossil fuels by 2030; starting in 2016, renewable energy will be able to fuel 90% of the city’s district heating system, up from 80% today. Increasing the use of renewable energy in transportation from 16% to 100% by 2040 will likely be the city’s most significant challenge, as this will entail removing all conventional fuel-powered vehicles from the city’s streets. To achieve this goal, the city plans to double the capacity of the public transport system, while improving walking and biking infrastructure.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

            October 2015        Los Angeles has integrated its wide-reaching sustainability plan into all municipal departments in the pursuit of an impressive list of “firsts” within the world of sustainable city development.Consecutive years of drought and extreme heat, combined with an increasing population, have left Los Angeles vulnerable to the effects of climate change. As water scarcity is a particularly severe problem in the region, pLAn has set the city on track to reduce the purchase of imported water by 50% by 2025, and to source 50% of water locally by 2035.Launched in 2014, Los Angeles’ ambitious and comprehensive 20-year sustainable development strategy, pLAn, aims to make California’s largest city a national leader in sustainable development. Under the plan, Los Angeles plans to be the first large American city to achieve an 80% waste diversion rate by 2017, while at the same time seeking the title of most new green jobs created. Additionally, the city plans to derive 50% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and support active and public transit such that, by 2025, 50% of all journeys will be taken by foot, bike, or public transit, up from 26% in 2012Another important “first,” which will be necessary in order to achieve the impressive goals: Los Angeles is the first American city to incorporate a sustainability plan into department performance reviews and budget prioritization, and to require Chief Sustainability Officers at the department level. By integrating the sustainability plan into every level of city government, Los Angeles is poised to circumvent traditional municipal bureaucratic hurdles and ensure that the plan leads to meaningful action, all while ensuring accountability and transparency.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

            October 2015        By measuring its water and carbon footprints, Quito is developing tailor-made, cost-effective policies and projects that help the city develop sustainably while reducing its climate impact.Rising temperatures, decreased rainfall, and more frequent extreme weather events are forcing Quito to more efficiently manage its energy and water use. The carbon and water footprint measurement tool helps city officials sculpt policies and projects that will lower Quito’s energy use. Quito plans to expand these mechanisms to the private sector in the coming years to make an even greater impact on the city’s carbon and water footprints.In Quito, Ecuador, the use of carbon and water footprint assessment tools led the city to develop a targeted Action Plan of initiatives to lower its CO2 emissions and water use. The plan is divided into two “portfolios.” The carbon portfolio includes actions that reduce Quito’s CO2 emissions by 20% by 2032. As one of the many initiatives planned to achieve this goal, Quito will complete a landfill biogas project that will reduce CO2 emissions by almost 5.5 million tons each year. Other initiatives include the creation of solar power plants, which will avoid the generation of 1.42 million tons of CO2 emissions annually.Similarly, in order to avoid the use of 1.5 billion m3 of water by 2032 – cutting the city’s water footprint by 68% – Quito is instituting policies that promote the use of water efficient appliances, ecological toilets, vacuum systems, and water reuse. Through these carbon and water footprint tools, the city is demonstrating how to translate energy assessments and observations into customized and measureable targets and policies.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

Cities100: Stockholm - Becoming Fossil Fuel-free by 2040
#################################################################################

            October 2015        The Swedish capital is planning and executing impressive policies across all sectors in order to move beyond carbon neutrality and reach the goal of producing zero CO2 emissions in the next 25 years.Stockholm aims to be a true world leader as the largest city to become fossil-fuel free. In the past few years it has surpassed many of its climate change goals, proving it has the political will and technical experience necessary to achieve its ambitious target of a renewably-fueled future.In 2012, the City of Stockholm set the goal of becoming fossil fuel-free by 2050. Driven by ambitious leadership and actionable goals, in 2015, the city pushed the target date up by a decade, and now plans to run exclusively on renewable energy by 2040. The comprehensive plan relies on overall energy reduction and an increase in renewable energy use. For instance, energy standards for new buildings built on city-owned land are 55 kWh/m2 compared with national standards of 80 kWh/m2. Similarly, the city aims to reduce energy use in the building sector by 50% between 1995 and 2050.By 2040, natural gas will be entirely phased out of the city’s energy grid and heating system, replaced primarily by biogas. The energy company that provides district heating is particularly ambitious and has decided to phase out fossil fuels by 2030; starting in 2016, renewable energy will be able to fuel 90% of the city’s district heating system, up from 80% today. Increasing the use of renewable energy in transportation from 16% to 100% by 2040 will likely be the city’s most significant challenge, as this will entail removing all conventional fuel-powered vehicles from the city’s streets. To achieve this goal, the city plans to double the capacity of the public transport system, while improving walking and biking infrastructure.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

Cities100: Los Angeles - Sustainability Embedded in Every City Department
#################################################################################

            October 2015        Los Angeles has integrated its wide-reaching sustainability plan into all municipal departments in the pursuit of an impressive list of “firsts” within the world of sustainable city development.Consecutive years of drought and extreme heat, combined with an increasing population, have left Los Angeles vulnerable to the effects of climate change. As water scarcity is a particularly severe problem in the region, pLAn has set the city on track to reduce the purchase of imported water by 50% by 2025, and to source 50% of water locally by 2035.Launched in 2014, Los Angeles’ ambitious and comprehensive 20-year sustainable development strategy, pLAn, aims to make California’s largest city a national leader in sustainable development. Under the plan, Los Angeles plans to be the first large American city to achieve an 80% waste diversion rate by 2017, while at the same time seeking the title of most new green jobs created. Additionally, the city plans to derive 50% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and support active and public transit such that, by 2025, 50% of all journeys will be taken by foot, bike, or public transit, up from 26% in 2012Another important “first,” which will be necessary in order to achieve the impressive goals: Los Angeles is the first American city to incorporate a sustainability plan into department performance reviews and budget prioritization, and to require Chief Sustainability Officers at the department level. By integrating the sustainability plan into every level of city government, Los Angeles is poised to circumvent traditional municipal bureaucratic hurdles and ensure that the plan leads to meaningful action, all while ensuring accountability and transparency.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

The carbon and water footprint measurement tool helps city officials sculpt policies and projects that will lower Quito’s energy use. Quito plans to expand these mechanisms to the private sector in the coming years to make an even greater impact on the city’s carbon and water footprints.In Quito, Ecuador, the use of carbon and water footprint assessment tools led the city to develop a targeted Action Plan of initiatives to lower its CO2 emissions and water use. The plan is divided into two “portfolios.” The carbon portfolio includes actions that reduce Quito’s CO2 emissions by 20% by 2032. As one of the many initiatives planned to achieve this goal, Quito will complete a landfill biogas project that will reduce CO2 emissions by almost 5.5 million tons each year. Other initiatives include the creation of solar power plants, which will avoid the generation of 1.42 million tons of CO2 emissions annually.Similarly, in order to avoid the use of 1.5 billion m3 of water by 2032 – cutting the city’s water footprint by 68% – Quito is instituting policies that promote the use of water efficient appliances, ecological toilets, vacuum systems, and water reuse. Through these carbon and water footprint tools, the city is demonstrating how to translate energy assessments and observations into customized and measureable targets and policies.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

            October 2015        Long defined by its oil dependence, Dubai seeks to change its reputation and position itself as a regional leader in sustainable development and green growth.Throughout the United Arab Emirates, up to 85% of the population and 90% of the infrastructure of coastal zones are at risk from climate change. Such vulnerability, combined with expected population growth, has led the city to create strategies and programs that decouple economic growth from CO2 emissions.Dubai seeks to become a regional leader in sustainable development and green growth through its Carbon Abatement Strategy (CAS) 2021. Focusing primarily on the power, water, and waste sectors, the CAS seeks to eliminate 11 million tons of CO2 by 2021. Launched in 2012, the CAS has already increased resource and system efficiency by yielding water savings of nearly 16 million m3 between 2011 and 2014, increasing the recycling rate to 10% from almost 0% in three years, and committing 48 km2 for the development of large-scale utility solar power projects.Dubai’s CO2 reduction targets may not be as ambitious as those of other cities, but they are an important step in the United Arab Emirates’ transition toward more sustainable development and a significant departure from its past. Dubai is already a global business destination and is seen by many cities in the region as a source of innovation.

The ambitious GCAP builds on decades of positive climate action and will help Vancouver achieve its climate goals, such as reducing its ecological footprint by 33% and exceeding the highest regional, national, and WHO air quality guidelines.Vancouver’s 2011 Greenest City Action Plan (GCAP) sets the overall sustainability direction for this Canadian city’s future development, focusing on job creation, carbon emission reduction, and local food systems, in the hopes of becoming the greenest city in the world. Green jobs and local food systems play a major role in this plan. By 2020, the GCAP aims to double the number of green jobs and green companies, and action is already being taken. Since 2010, green building design and construction jobs have increased by 50%. Similarly, local food jobs have grown by 21% and green transportation-related jobs have grown by 19%, largely through local electric vehicle infrastructure projects and increasing demand for car-sharing services.Aside from green job growth and local food systems, Vancouver’s GCAP also requires all new buildings from 2020 onwards to be carbon neutral and that the volume of solid waste going to the landfill or the incinerator be reduced by 50%. In all, the city’s nearly 170 actions, completed or underway, ensure that GCAP targets will be achieved and that the city is transparent and accountable throughout the process.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

Cities100: Los Angeles - Sustainability Embedded in Every City Department
#################################################################################

            October 2015        Los Angeles has integrated its wide-reaching sustainability plan into all municipal departments in the pursuit of an impressive list of “firsts” within the world of sustainable city development.Consecutive years of drought and extreme heat, combined with an increasing population, have left Los Angeles vulnerable to the effects of climate change. As water scarcity is a particularly severe problem in the region, pLAn has set the city on track to reduce the purchase of imported water by 50% by 2025, and to source 50% of water locally by 2035.Launched in 2014, Los Angeles’ ambitious and comprehensive 20-year sustainable development strategy, pLAn, aims to make California’s largest city a national leader in sustainable development. Under the plan, Los Angeles plans to be the first large American city to achieve an 80% waste diversion rate by 2017, while at the same time seeking the title of most new green jobs created. Additionally, the city plans to derive 50% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and support active and public transit such that, by 2025, 50% of all journeys will be taken by foot, bike, or public transit, up from 26% in 2012Another important “first,” which will be necessary in order to achieve the impressive goals: Los Angeles is the first American city to incorporate a sustainability plan into department performance reviews and budget prioritization, and to require Chief Sustainability Officers at the department level. By integrating the sustainability plan into every level of city government, Los Angeles is poised to circumvent traditional municipal bureaucratic hurdles and ensure that the plan leads to meaningful action, all while ensuring accountability and transparency.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

Cities100: Stockholm - Becoming Fossil Fuel-free by 2040
#################################################################################

            October 2015        The Swedish capital is planning and executing impressive policies across all sectors in order to move beyond carbon neutrality and reach the goal of producing zero CO2 emissions in the next 25 years.Stockholm aims to be a true world leader as the largest city to become fossil-fuel free. In the past few years it has surpassed many of its climate change goals, proving it has the political will and technical experience necessary to achieve its ambitious target of a renewably-fueled future.In 2012, the City of Stockholm set the goal of becoming fossil fuel-free by 2050. Driven by ambitious leadership and actionable goals, in 2015, the city pushed the target date up by a decade, and now plans to run exclusively on renewable energy by 2040. The comprehensive plan relies on overall energy reduction and an increase in renewable energy use. For instance, energy standards for new buildings built on city-owned land are 55 kWh/m2 compared with national standards of 80 kWh/m2. Similarly, the city aims to reduce energy use in the building sector by 50% between 1995 and 2050.By 2040, natural gas will be entirely phased out of the city’s energy grid and heating system, replaced primarily by biogas. The energy company that provides district heating is particularly ambitious and has decided to phase out fossil fuels by 2030; starting in 2016, renewable energy will be able to fuel 90% of the city’s district heating system, up from 80% today. Increasing the use of renewable energy in transportation from 16% to 100% by 2040 will likely be the city’s most significant challenge, as this will entail removing all conventional fuel-powered vehicles from the city’s streets. To achieve this goal, the city plans to double the capacity of the public transport system, while improving walking and biking infrastructure.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

#################################################################################

            October 2015        Vancouver aims to become the greenest city in the world by 2020, in large part by developing green jobs and industries and promoting sustainable local food systems.Vancouver’s population is constantly growing, and its coastal location makes it vulnerable to rising sea levels. The ambitious GCAP builds on decades of positive climate action and will help Vancouver achieve its climate goals, such as reducing its ecological footprint by 33% and exceeding the highest regional, national, and WHO air quality guidelines.Vancouver’s 2011 Greenest City Action Plan (GCAP) sets the overall sustainability direction for this Canadian city’s future development, focusing on job creation, carbon emission reduction, and local food systems, in the hopes of becoming the greenest city in the world. Green jobs and local food systems play a major role in this plan. By 2020, the GCAP aims to double the number of green jobs and green companies, and action is already being taken. Since 2010, green building design and construction jobs have increased by 50%. Similarly, local food jobs have grown by 21% and green transportation-related jobs have grown by 19%, largely through local electric vehicle infrastructure projects and increasing demand for car-sharing services.Aside from green job growth and local food systems, Vancouver’s GCAP also requires all new buildings from 2020 onwards to be carbon neutral and that the volume of solid waste going to the landfill or the incinerator be reduced by 50%. In all, the city’s nearly 170 actions, completed or underway, ensure that GCAP targets will be achieved and that the city is transparent and accountable throughout the process.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

            October 2015        Long defined by its oil dependence, Dubai seeks to change its reputation and position itself as a regional leader in sustainable development and green growth.Throughout the United Arab Emirates, up to 85% of the population and 90% of the infrastructure of coastal zones are at risk from climate change. Such vulnerability, combined with expected population growth, has led the city to create strategies and programs that decouple economic growth from CO2 emissions.Dubai seeks to become a regional leader in sustainable development and green growth through its Carbon Abatement Strategy (CAS) 2021. Focusing primarily on the power, water, and waste sectors, the CAS seeks to eliminate 11 million tons of CO2 by 2021. Launched in 2012, the CAS has already increased resource and system efficiency by yielding water savings of nearly 16 million m3 between 2011 and 2014, increasing the recycling rate to 10% from almost 0% in three years, and committing 48 km2 for the development of large-scale utility solar power projects.Dubai’s CO2 reduction targets may not be as ambitious as those of other cities, but they are an important step in the United Arab Emirates’ transition toward more sustainable development and a significant departure from its past. Dubai is already a global business destination and is seen by many cities in the region as a source of innovation. The CAS’s focus on green economic development, led by the Green Economy Partnerships program, which encourages green trade and investment and accelerates the adoption of green technologies, products, and services, showcases to the entire region that green growth and reduced fossil fuel dependence are economically viable and improve quality of life for citizens.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

            October 2015        Portland unveiled a climate plan that judges emissions based not only on what happens within its borders but also on where the city and its residents source their goods and services.Portland, Oregon, has been an American leader on climate change for many years. This ambitious plan builds on decades of action and takes the city a step further by analyzing how Portland residents’ and businesses’ purchasing habits influence greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere in the world. With this knowledge, the city is preparing for even more rigorous climate action in the future.A key feature of Portland’s 2015 Climate Action Program is its pioneering consumption-based emissions inventory methodology, enabling the city to drive down greenhouse gas emissions within and beyond its borders. The consumption inventory analyzes data on spending by Portland households, government agencies, and business capital investment, taking into account the entire value chain of a product or service. This method enables the city to track the emissions it is responsible for regardless of where those emissions took place, and to better comprehend exactly how the city contributes to climate change and can develop additional mitigation opportunities.In addition to this new methodology, the comprehensive plan targets an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050, and includes a host of climate change-related targets for 2020, such as increasing the combined mode share for transit, bicycling, and walking to at least 50%, reducing energy use in existing buildings by 1.7% annually, and increasing the total recovery of solid waste to 80%.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

            October 2015        Milan has launched the world’s first free-floating and integrated ride-sharing system, allowing residents and visitors access to electric cars, bikes, and scooters anytime, anywhere.Milan has long been known as a car-loving city, with more than one vehicle for every two people – one of the highest rates in Europe. The project is changing this reputation by providing viable alternatives to private car ownership, and making it easier than ever for residents and visitors to make more sustainable transportation choices.Started in 2013 and now operating with more than 2,000 cars, 150 scooters, and 4,600 bikes, Milan’s “All you can share” mobility system is convincing the city, and the world, that private car ownership is a thing of the past. While the bikes – 1,000 of which are electric – can be picked up and dropped off at fixed stations, the scooters and cars – half of which will be electric by the end of 2015 – are available throughout the city without set locations. They are part of an integrated and easy-to-operate system that users manage via a dedicated smartphone app. Riders just log on, find an available ride near their current location, and hit the road.The scale of this project is critical to its success. Without a critical mass of vehicles and bicycles to choose from, such a program could not work. The city’s bike-share system boasts 39,000 yearly subscribers, while the car-share system has nearly 300,000. The electric scooter system just launched this year, but anticipates similar success.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

Cities100: Los Angeles - Sustainability Embedded in Every City Department
#################################################################################

            October 2015        Los Angeles has integrated its wide-reaching sustainability plan into all municipal departments in the pursuit of an impressive list of “firsts” within the world of sustainable city development.Consecutive years of drought and extreme heat, combined with an increasing population, have left Los Angeles vulnerable to the effects of climate change. As water scarcity is a particularly severe problem in the region, pLAn has set the city on track to reduce the purchase of imported water by 50% by 2025, and to source 50% of water locally by 2035.Launched in 2014, Los Angeles’ ambitious and comprehensive 20-year sustainable development strategy, pLAn, aims to make California’s largest city a national leader in sustainable development. Under the plan, Los Angeles plans to be the first large American city to achieve an 80% waste diversion rate by 2017, while at the same time seeking the title of most new green jobs created. Additionally, the city plans to derive 50% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and support active and public transit such that, by 2025, 50% of all journeys will be taken by foot, bike, or public transit, up from 26% in 2012Another important “first,” which will be necessary in order to achieve the impressive goals: Los Angeles is the first American city to incorporate a sustainability plan into department performance reviews and budget prioritization, and to require Chief Sustainability Officers at the department level. By integrating the sustainability plan into every level of city government, Los Angeles is poised to circumvent traditional municipal bureaucratic hurdles and ensure that the plan leads to meaningful action, all while ensuring accountability and transparency.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

Cities100: Stockholm - Becoming Fossil Fuel-free by 2040
#################################################################################

            October 2015        The Swedish capital is planning and executing impressive policies across all sectors in order to move beyond carbon neutrality and reach the goal of producing zero CO2 emissions in the next 25 years.Stockholm aims to be a true world leader as the largest city to become fossil-fuel free. In the past few years it has surpassed many of its climate change goals, proving it has the political will and technical experience necessary to achieve its ambitious target of a renewably-fueled future.In 2012, the City of Stockholm set the goal of becoming fossil fuel-free by 2050. Driven by ambitious leadership and actionable goals, in 2015, the city pushed the target date up by a decade, and now plans to run exclusively on renewable energy by 2040. The comprehensive plan relies on overall energy reduction and an increase in renewable energy use. For instance, energy standards for new buildings built on city-owned land are 55 kWh/m2 compared with national standards of 80 kWh/m2. Similarly, the city aims to reduce energy use in the building sector by 50% between 1995 and 2050.By 2040, natural gas will be entirely phased out of the city’s energy grid and heating system, replaced primarily by biogas. The energy company that provides district heating is particularly ambitious and has decided to phase out fossil fuels by 2030; starting in 2016, renewable energy will be able to fuel 90% of the city’s district heating system, up from 80% today. Increasing the use of renewable energy in transportation from 16% to 100% by 2040 will likely be the city’s most significant challenge, as this will entail removing all conventional fuel-powered vehicles from the city’s streets. To achieve this goal, the city plans to double the capacity of the public transport system, while improving walking and biking infrastructure.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

            October 2015        Long defined by its oil dependence, Dubai seeks to change its reputation and position itself as a regional leader in sustainable development and green growth.Throughout the United Arab Emirates, up to 85% of the population and 90% of the infrastructure of coastal zones are at risk from climate change. Such vulnerability, combined with expected population growth, has led the city to create strategies and programs that decouple economic growth from CO2 emissions.Dubai seeks to become a regional leader in sustainable development and green growth through its Carbon Abatement Strategy (CAS) 2021. Focusing primarily on the power, water, and waste sectors, the CAS seeks to eliminate 11 million tons of CO2 by 2021. Launched in 2012, the CAS has already increased resource and system efficiency by yielding water savings of nearly 16 million m3 between 2011 and 2014, increasing the recycling rate to 10% from almost 0% in three years, and committing 48 km2 for the development of large-scale utility solar power projects.Dubai’s CO2 reduction targets may not be as ambitious as those of other cities, but they are an important step in the United Arab Emirates’ transition toward more sustainable development and a significant departure from its past. Dubai is already a global business destination and is seen by many cities in the region as a source of innovation. The CAS’s focus on green economic development, led by the Green Economy Partnerships program, which encourages green trade and investment and accelerates the adoption of green technologies, products, and services, showcases to the entire region that green growth and reduced fossil fuel dependence are economically viable and improve quality of life for citizens.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

By training a diverse pool of outgoing residents from across the city on the importance of sustainability and climate programs, along with specific action residents can take, the District has been much more successful in engaging the broader community and making progress towards its goals.The Sustainable DC Ambassadors Program is a community volunteer program in the American capital. The program trains District residents to talk to their neighbors about the importance of energy efficiency, renewable energy, water conservation, and sustainable materials management, and how these issues impact their daily lives. Through its online tracking program, Ambassadors’ outreach is recorded to ensure that messages are being spread to as many people as possible, and that a diverse array of neighborhoods, particularly disadvantaged communities, are reached. In 2013, staff and volunteers had 6,320 conversations and 127 community events; the next year, they spoke to 8,030 people at 132 events. The program is on track to increase its numbers even further in 2015.With a strong emphasis on underserved populations within the city, the 60 trained Sustainable DC Ambassadors of the 2015 program engage their communities in meaningful conversations about sustainability at a level that is not possible when delivered by government representatives alone.

Although cities are increasingly buying ultra-low emission buses, such as electric, hydrogen, and hybrid buses, by 2014 there had been no corresponding reduction in price as sales increased. Discussions with manufacturers made clear that this was because of a perceived lack of commitment to new technologies by a large enough number of cities. By getting 24 cities on board the Clean Bus Declaration, this cross-city initiative is able to prove to manufacturers and industry stakeholders that public transit systems around the world are ready for a change. If signatory cities reach their collective goal of 40,000 hybrid and electric buses by 2020, the project will save 880,528 tons of CO2 annually.London has committed $510 million so that by 2020, all 300 single-deck buses in central London will be zero emission capable and all 3,000 double-deck buses will be hybrid. In Bogotá, the aim is for the existing fleet of 1,200 diesel buses to be replaced with hybrid or electric models by 2020.

            October 2015        The Indian City of Chennai has adopted a policy to prioritize walking and cycling and discourage the use of motorized vehicles, renewing the city’s approach to transportation.Despite a lack of safe infrastructure for non-motorized transport, one third of all trips in the city are already made on foot and bicycle. Chennai Street Design Project will ensure that these trips become safer, healthier, and more enjoyable through a redesigned urban transportation network.With more than 10,000 traffic crashes reported every year, Chennai has one of the highest rates of road deaths in India. In 2012, the city government launched the Chennai Street Design Project to address this problem. This project aims to reclaim the city’s streets for pedestrians and cyclists by prioritizing modes of transport other than private automobiles.The policy requires at least 60% of the city’s transport budget to be allocated to constructing and maintaining infrastructure for non-motorized transit. This includes widening sidewalks, building safe bicycle infrastructure, better managing intersections, and even implementing street furniture. By 2018, the city aims to have built safe and continuous footpaths on at least 80% of all streets, increase the share of walking and cycling trips to more than 40%, and, most significantly, eliminate pedestrian and cyclist deaths.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

            October 2015        Milan has launched the world’s first free-floating and integrated ride-sharing system, allowing residents and visitors access to electric cars, bikes, and scooters anytime, anywhere.Milan has long been known as a car-loving city, with more than one vehicle for every two people – one of the highest rates in Europe. The project is changing this reputation by providing viable alternatives to private car ownership, and making it easier than ever for residents and visitors to make more sustainable transportation choices.Started in 2013 and now operating with more than 2,000 cars, 150 scooters, and 4,600 bikes, Milan’s “All you can share” mobility system is convincing the city, and the world, that private car ownership is a thing of the past. While the bikes – 1,000 of which are electric – can be picked up and dropped off at fixed stations, the scooters and cars – half of which will be electric by the end of 2015 – are available throughout the city without set locations. They are part of an integrated and easy-to-operate system that users manage via a dedicated smartphone app. Riders just log on, find an available ride near their current location, and hit the road.The scale of this project is critical to its success. Without a critical mass of vehicles and bicycles to choose from, such a program could not work. The city’s bike-share system boasts 39,000 yearly subscribers, while the car-share system has nearly 300,000. The electric scooter system just launched this year, but anticipates similar success.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

#################################################################################

            October 2015        San Francisco is linking health and climate change impacts under a program that aims to educate and empower citizens and public agencies to improve resilience.For the last decade, cities have invested in developing climate action plans to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, yet less attention has been paid to developing adaptive measures to protect public health during climate change-related extreme weather events. This program seeks to rebrand climate change as a public health issue and has partnered with city agencies to educate them about climate change health impacts.Climate change is expected to more seriously affect the health and well-being of communities that are least able to prepare for, cope with, and recover from the impacts, such as the fact that extreme heat days in San Francisco are projected to increase by up to 40 days per year. To address this challenge, the City and County of San Francisco’s Climate and Health Program is successfully addressing the public health impacts of climate change by leveraging data driven planning and health indicators to create policies around climate adaptation on a local level.By centralizing and formalizing the collection of neighborhood-level data, the program provides neighborhood organizations, city departments, and direct service providers a simple, streamlined way to access information on climate and health. The Community Resilience Index is a summary of 36 equally weighted indicators from nine categories, such as hazards, environment, housing, economy, and demography. The index scores are visualized on neighborhood-level maps on a website where all data is open-access. The innovative use of data and assessments has initiated a public dialogue on the link between climate change and health, and resulted in actions to strengthen community resilience.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

#################################################################################

            October 2015        The Argentine capital launched a water and weather monitoring system to help prepare for and prevent damaging floods.In recent years, Buenos Aires has set records for rainfall and heat waves, and the intensity of storms and flooding is expected to increase in the future. The frequent floods have caused property damage, loss of income, negative public health impacts, and impaired living and working conditions. These events led the city to develop a monitoring system in order to help prevent and lessen the consequences of floods.Buenos Aires has created a hydro-meteorological monitoring system to provide reliable and accurate information needed for planning and emergency management, risk management and flood mitigation, as well as for monitoring and protecting water resources. The monitoring system consists of a network of interconnected sensors that automatically measures and monitors meteorological, hydrological, and environmental parameters. So far, 30 information collection points have been installed, with more sensors underdevelopment. With the knowledge of changes in rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind direction and speed, and stream water level, the city can generate much more reliable community alerts and make better-informed, real-time decisions during emergencies.With the data derived from the monitoring system, Buenos Aires will be better equipped for emergency management by pre-empting social and medical assistance needs; predicting and monitoring weather phenomena; automatically operating pumping stations and floodgates; issuing warnings to key institutions and the public; and sending cleaning crews to compromised drains. All these data-informed actions can save lives, infrastructure, and money.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

            October 2015        A retrofit program in Melbourne uses a web-based tool to allow apartment owners to track and manage their building’s energy-saving and renewable energy projects online and solicit expert advice on upgrade options.Apartment buildings in Australia consume 25% more energy per resident than stand-alone homes. About half of this energy is consumed by “common property” assets such as hallway lighting, parking lot ventilation, and pool pumps. The process to make changes to common property has been highly regulated and challenging. With more than 70% of Melbourne’s residents living in apartments, Smart Blocks helps this sector become more sustainable.Smart Blocks is a building retrofit program in Melbourne, Australia, underpinned by a comprehensive online interface equipping residents within a building with tools to work collaboratively, learn about apartment living and sustainability, and manage projects from initiation to completion. An owners’ corporation, composed of individual apartment owners in a building, signs their building up for the service, enters detailed information about the building, and then receives expert advice and feedback regarding optimal retrofit options, quote request templates, and payback calculators. Through the tool, users can then track energy usage statistics over time. These tools and services help building owners make the most informed and economically viable choices regarding retrofit options and ensure that progress is tracked and recorded.So far, 125 Melbourne buildings have signed up for the program, representing 10% of the city’s building stock. Already, 40 energy efficiency or renewable energy projects have been completed using the online tool, and 67 more are underway. The program aims to help Melbourne achieve its goals of producing zero net emissions by 2020 and using 25% renewable energy by 2018.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

            October 2015        The Indian City of Chennai has adopted a policy to prioritize walking and cycling and discourage the use of motorized vehicles, renewing the city’s approach to transportation.Despite a lack of safe infrastructure for non-motorized transport, one third of all trips in the city are already made on foot and bicycle. Chennai Street Design Project will ensure that these trips become safer, healthier, and more enjoyable through a redesigned urban transportation network.With more than 10,000 traffic crashes reported every year, Chennai has one of the highest rates of road deaths in India. In 2012, the city government launched the Chennai Street Design Project to address this problem. This project aims to reclaim the city’s streets for pedestrians and cyclists by prioritizing modes of transport other than private automobiles.The policy requires at least 60% of the city’s transport budget to be allocated to constructing and maintaining infrastructure for non-motorized transit. This includes widening sidewalks, building safe bicycle infrastructure, better managing intersections, and even implementing street furniture. By 2018, the city aims to have built safe and continuous footpaths on at least 80% of all streets, increase the share of walking and cycling trips to more than 40%, and, most significantly, eliminate pedestrian and cyclist deaths.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

Cities100: Boston - New Media Engages Residents in Climate Action
#################################################################################

            October 2015        Boston’s sustainability messaging and branding campaign uses digital media and monitoring systems to engage residents in achieving climate goals.Greenovate Boston was designed to ensure that constituents were not just targets of outreach, but active contributors to the content of the program. To solve this challenge, Greenovate Boston took advantage of the rapidly expanding social media universe to spur a variety of climate actions at home, at work, and in communities.After recognizing that many climate-related projects – such as those related to transportation, air pollution, food, and solid waste – were handled by many different city departments, each with its own brand and logo, Boston officials created Greenovate Boston to unify the separate brands and establish a broad platform for communication, community engagement, and recognition of achievement. In order to help constituents clearly understand the interrelatedness of the city’s climate programs, Greenovate Boston uses social media and newsletters to reach multiple audiences, and utilizes a state-of-the art system to track and measure how well campaigns and events spur environmental actionGreenovate Boston’s “Solarize Boston” initiative incentivized installation of residential rooftop photovoltaic systems; in a six-month period in 2012, this program led to 116 projects with a combined capacity of 522 kW. Greenovate Boston has also contributed to a record 4 billion transit riders in 2014. In 2014, Greenovate Boston established additional goals for 2020, including 36,000 additional residential home weatherization and significant energy upgrades, 10 MW of additional solar capacity on commercial buildings, and a 5.5% reduction in distance traveled by cars, below 2005 levels.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

Cities100: Seoul - Data-driven Public Service Development
#################################################################################

            October 2015        In Seoul, a smart city project is using wide-ranging data to optimize public services to the needs of citizens and to address environmental concerns.Seoul has recognized that many of its environmental, social, and economic issues could be addressed by applying smarter information and communications technology (ICT) to the city’s public services and capitalizing on the widespread use of social media and mobile devices. Smart Seoul 2015 aims to effectively manage rapid changes in the urban environment and strategies for spearheading future ICT developments.Smart Seoul 2015 is a plan for the e-governance of Seoul that strives to create an innovative urban culture based on IT and data. Under the project, data, often generated by citizens themselves, help City of Seoul officials make more informed decisions and develop real-time, mobile-based services that cater to citizens’ diverse needs. As citizen access to digital data is vital for the project’s success, fast public Wi-Fi is available at 972 hotspots across Seoul, including throughout the city’s subway networks as well as parks and other public facilities.Data for the project is collected through various e-government functions and the country’s private sector. For instance, the available pool of big data on telephone calls and transportation helped the city revise and streamline nighttime bus routes along the five most trafficked routes, resulting in increased public satisfaction as well as reduced fuel consumption. Another initiative under the project is a mapping application providing 3D street information, which can be used to predict which areas will be most affected by floods, thereby enabling the development of preemptive flood-response measures.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

Cities100: San Francisco - Coupling Public Health and Climate Resilience
#################################################################################

            October 2015        San Francisco is linking health and climate change impacts under a program that aims to educate and empower citizens and public agencies to improve resilience.For the last decade, cities have invested in developing climate action plans to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, yet less attention has been paid to developing adaptive measures to protect public health during climate change-related extreme weather events. This program seeks to rebrand climate change as a public health issue and has partnered with city agencies to educate them about climate change health impacts.Climate change is expected to more seriously affect the health and well-being of communities that are least able to prepare for, cope with, and recover from the impacts, such as the fact that extreme heat days in San Francisco are projected to increase by up to 40 days per year. To address this challenge, the City and County of San Francisco’s Climate and Health Program is successfully addressing the public health impacts of climate change by leveraging data driven planning and health indicators to create policies around climate adaptation on a local level.By centralizing and formalizing the collection of neighborhood-level data, the program provides neighborhood organizations, city departments, and direct service providers a simple, streamlined way to access information on climate and health. The Community Resilience Index is a summary of 36 equally weighted indicators from nine categories, such as hazards, environment, housing, economy, and demography. The index scores are visualized on neighborhood-level maps on a website where all data is open-access. The innovative use of data and assessments has initiated a public dialogue on the link between climate change and health, and resulted in actions to strengthen community resilience.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

Cities100: Buenos Aires - Monitoring Climate Data for Flood Prevention
#################################################################################

            October 2015        The Argentine capital launched a water and weather monitoring system to help prepare for and prevent damaging floods.In recent years, Buenos Aires has set records for rainfall and heat waves, and the intensity of storms and flooding is expected to increase in the future. The frequent floods have caused property damage, loss of income, negative public health impacts, and impaired living and working conditions. These events led the city to develop a monitoring system in order to help prevent and lessen the consequences of floods.Buenos Aires has created a hydro-meteorological monitoring system to provide reliable and accurate information needed for planning and emergency management, risk management and flood mitigation, as well as for monitoring and protecting water resources. The monitoring system consists of a network of interconnected sensors that automatically measures and monitors meteorological, hydrological, and environmental parameters. So far, 30 information collection points have been installed, with more sensors underdevelopment. With the knowledge of changes in rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind direction and speed, and stream water level, the city can generate much more reliable community alerts and make better-informed, real-time decisions during emergencies.With the data derived from the monitoring system, Buenos Aires will be better equipped for emergency management by pre-empting social and medical assistance needs; predicting and monitoring weather phenomena; automatically operating pumping stations and floodgates; issuing warnings to key institutions and the public; and sending cleaning crews to compromised drains. All these data-informed actions can save lives, infrastructure, and money.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

Cities100: Melbourne - Web Tool Enables Building Retrofits
#################################################################################

            October 2015        A retrofit program in Melbourne uses a web-based tool to allow apartment owners to track and manage their building’s energy-saving and renewable energy projects online and solicit expert advice on upgrade options.Apartment buildings in Australia consume 25% more energy per resident than stand-alone homes. About half of this energy is consumed by “common property” assets such as hallway lighting, parking lot ventilation, and pool pumps. The process to make changes to common property has been highly regulated and challenging. With more than 70% of Melbourne’s residents living in apartments, Smart Blocks helps this sector become more sustainable.Smart Blocks is a building retrofit program in Melbourne, Australia, underpinned by a comprehensive online interface equipping residents within a building with tools to work collaboratively, learn about apartment living and sustainability, and manage projects from initiation to completion. An owners’ corporation, composed of individual apartment owners in a building, signs their building up for the service, enters detailed information about the building, and then receives expert advice and feedback regarding optimal retrofit options, quote request templates, and payback calculators. Through the tool, users can then track energy usage statistics over time. These tools and services help building owners make the most informed and economically viable choices regarding retrofit options and ensure that progress is tracked and recorded.So far, 125 Melbourne buildings have signed up for the program, representing 10% of the city’s building stock. Already, 40 energy efficiency or renewable energy projects have been completed using the online tool, and 67 more are underway. The program aims to help Melbourne achieve its goals of producing zero net emissions by 2020 and using 25% renewable energy by 2018.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

            October 2015        The Sustainable DC Ambassador program trains Washington, D.C. residents to engage with their communities and make sustainability accessible and relevant for everyone, while tracking data on the results of the engagement.Without strong community buy-in and subsequent action, the District will not be able to reach its sustainability or climate goals. By training a diverse pool of outgoing residents from across the city on the importance of sustainability and climate programs, along with specific action residents can take, the District has been much more successful in engaging the broader community and making progress towards its goals.The Sustainable DC Ambassadors Program is a community volunteer program in the American capital. The program trains District residents to talk to their neighbors about the importance of energy efficiency, renewable energy, water conservation, and sustainable materials management, and how these issues impact their daily lives. Through its online tracking program, Ambassadors’ outreach is recorded to ensure that messages are being spread to as many people as possible, and that a diverse array of neighborhoods, particularly disadvantaged communities, are reached. In 2013, staff and volunteers had 6,320 conversations and 127 community events; the next year, they spoke to 8,030 people at 132 events. The program is on track to increase its numbers even further in 2015.With a strong emphasis on underserved populations within the city, the 60 trained Sustainable DC Ambassadors of the 2015 program engage their communities in meaningful conversations about sustainability at a level that is not possible when delivered by government representatives alone. The program helps the city achieve its 2032 climate goals, such as reducing water consumption by 40% and reducing waste generation by 15%.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

Cities100: New York City - Green Campaigns Change Consumer Behavior
#################################################################################

            October 2015        By using positive messaging via targeted media to support New Yorkers’ in reducing their personal waste, GreeNYC has made a meaningful dent in the amount of paper and plastic wasted in the city.New York City’s sanitation department annually collects about 10 billion single-use bags, 315,000 tons of paper for recycling, and about 800 million water bottles discarded by city residents. Similarly, New Yorkers receive an estimated 2 billion pieces of unwanted mail each year. The city’s GreeNYC campaign gets residents involved in behavior changing initiatives in order to stop this unnecessary waste and promote civic engagement.GreeNYC is New York City’s branding campaign to reduce waste and encourage more sustainable habits by all New Yorkers. Informed and measured by robust consumer behavior and environmental impact data, the campaign uses positive messaging and resident engagement to drive environmental behavior change. GreeNYC programs have reached more than 3 billion New Yorkers through marketing campaigns, and half of all New York City residents report familiarity with the program. The city has even created a GreeNYC mascot, “Birdie,” to get residents on board with conservation and environmental awareness.GreeNYC’s 2014 “Stop Junk Mail” initiative, and the 2015 B.Y.O. (Bring Your Own) initiative to promote reusable water bottles, coffee mugs, and plastic bags, are examples of recent schemes targeting a high-impact area – in these cases, solid waste, using tailored marketing techniques for messaging and media planning. Stop Junk Mail has so far achieved a 1.75 million kg reduction in solid waste, and the B.Y.O. initiative has already avoided the use of 157 million disposable plastic bags.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

Cities100: Mexico City - Public Transit Integration Catapults Bike-share
#################################################################################

            October 2015        To create a true shift in transit habits, Mexico City integrated its bike-share program with the city’s public transport network, making bicycle commuting an easier, faster, and more obvious choice for citizens.The decades-long development of a car culture in Mexico City has resulted in the presence of more than 5 million automobiles on the city’s streets. This has led to enormous traffic congestion problems, as drivers spend an average of four hours a day commuting. ECOBICI’s integration into Mexico City’s transit system and sheer size encourage faster, healthier, and more sustainable transportation options.While bike-sharing systems have become commonplace in many large cities, Mexico City’s ECOBICI stands out as one of the few systems in the world that is integrated with the city’s overall public transit network. One card allows users to access the metro, buses, trains, and bicycles – making pedal-powered transport a viable commuting method. This integration is vital to the system’s success, as data from a 2014 User Perception Survey show that 87% of trips are made in combination with other modes of transportation.ECOBICI has seen a massive uptake in popularity, with the number of daily trips increasing from 3,053 in 2010 to 33,700 in 2015. This is thanks, in part, to the ECOBICI’s size: the system boasts 6,025 bikes at 444 docking stations across 42 neighborhoods of the city. Similarly, the integrated card has made the shift to bicycle use easier for residents, and it has allowed the system to overcome one of the biggest challenges in transportation: changing commuting habits. Six of 10 system users did not previously use a bicycle as a mode of transport before ECOBICI was launched, and 14.5% of users shifted from driving to biking.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.

            October 2015        Deploying a world-leading smart city model city-wide within a few years puts Yokohama on track to be transformed into a low carbon metropolis with lower energy use, more renewable power, and cleaner transport.With increasing urbanization, Yokohama is experiencing fast growth that poses challenges in terms of energy use, traffic jams, air pollution, and an overall increase in greenhouse gas emissions. The YSCP strives to better manage energy use and mitigate climate change through a rapid deployment of smart energy infrastructure.In 2010, the Japanese City of Yokohama formulated the Yokohama Smart City Project (YSCP) as a five-year pilot in three city districts. It has since been deployed to the entire city of 3.7 million people. The YSCP applies smart grids for the energy management of households, buildings, and local communities; introduces large-scale renewable energy; and promotes green transportation systems.Under the project, energy management systems have been installed in 4,200 homes, resulting in a 20% reduction in energy consumption through visualization of energy use and curbing power demand by providing consumers with incentives to limit electricity use. Similarly, energy management systems in offices and commercial buildings have resulted in a 20% reduction in peak energy consumption. In addition, the project has introduced 2,300 electric vehicles, and installed charging stations throughout the city.

Cities100: New York City - Green Campaigns Change Consumer Behavior
#################################################################################

            October 2015        By using positive messaging via targeted media to support New Yorkers’ in reducing their personal waste, GreeNYC has made a meaningful dent in the amount of paper and plastic wasted in the city.New York City’s sanitation department annually collects about 10 billion single-use bags, 315,000 tons of paper for recycling, and about 800 million water bottles discarded by city residents. Similarly, New Yorkers receive an estimated 2 billion pieces of unwanted mail each year. The city’s GreeNYC campaign gets residents involved in behavior changing initiatives in order to stop this unnecessary waste and promote civic engagement.GreeNYC is New York City’s branding campaign to reduce waste and encourage more sustainable habits by all New Yorkers. Informed and measured by robust consumer behavior and environmental impact data, the campaign uses positive messaging and resident engagement to drive environmental behavior change. GreeNYC programs have reached more than 3 billion New Yorkers through marketing campaigns, and half of all New York City residents report familiarity with the program. The city has even created a GreeNYC mascot, “Birdie,” to get residents on board with conservation and environmental awareness.GreeNYC’s 2014 “Stop Junk Mail” initiative, and the 2015 B.Y.O. (Bring Your Own) initiative to promote reusable water bottles, coffee mugs, and plastic bags, are examples of recent schemes targeting a high-impact area – in these cases, solid waste, using tailored marketing techniques for messaging and media planning. Stop Junk Mail has so far achieved a 1.75 million kg reduction in solid waste, and the B.Y.O. initiative has already avoided the use of 157 million disposable plastic bags.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

#################################################################################

            October 2015        To create a true shift in transit habits, Mexico City integrated its bike-share program with the city’s public transport network, making bicycle commuting an easier, faster, and more obvious choice for citizens.The decades-long development of a car culture in Mexico City has resulted in the presence of more than 5 million automobiles on the city’s streets. This has led to enormous traffic congestion problems, as drivers spend an average of four hours a day commuting. ECOBICI’s integration into Mexico City’s transit system and sheer size encourage faster, healthier, and more sustainable transportation options.While bike-sharing systems have become commonplace in many large cities, Mexico City’s ECOBICI stands out as one of the few systems in the world that is integrated with the city’s overall public transit network. One card allows users to access the metro, buses, trains, and bicycles – making pedal-powered transport a viable commuting method. This integration is vital to the system’s success, as data from a 2014 User Perception Survey show that 87% of trips are made in combination with other modes of transportation.ECOBICI has seen a massive uptake in popularity, with the number of daily trips increasing from 3,053 in 2010 to 33,700 in 2015. This is thanks, in part, to the ECOBICI’s size: the system boasts 6,025 bikes at 444 docking stations across 42 neighborhoods of the city. Similarly, the integrated card has made the shift to bicycle use easier for residents, and it has allowed the system to overcome one of the biggest challenges in transportation: changing commuting habits. Six of 10 system users did not previously use a bicycle as a mode of transport before ECOBICI was launched, and 14.5% of users shifted from driving to biking.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.

            October 2015        Boston’s sustainability messaging and branding campaign uses digital media and monitoring systems to engage residents in achieving climate goals.Greenovate Boston was designed to ensure that constituents were not just targets of outreach, but active contributors to the content of the program. To solve this challenge, Greenovate Boston took advantage of the rapidly expanding social media universe to spur a variety of climate actions at home, at work, and in communities.After recognizing that many climate-related projects – such as those related to transportation, air pollution, food, and solid waste – were handled by many different city departments, each with its own brand and logo, Boston officials created Greenovate Boston to unify the separate brands and establish a broad platform for communication, community engagement, and recognition of achievement. In order to help constituents clearly understand the interrelatedness of the city’s climate programs, Greenovate Boston uses social media and newsletters to reach multiple audiences, and utilizes a state-of-the art system to track and measure how well campaigns and events spur environmental actionGreenovate Boston’s “Solarize Boston” initiative incentivized installation of residential rooftop photovoltaic systems; in a six-month period in 2012, this program led to 116 projects with a combined capacity of 522 kW. Greenovate Boston has also contributed to a record 4 billion transit riders in 2014. In 2014, Greenovate Boston established additional goals for 2020, including 36,000 additional residential home weatherization and significant energy upgrades, 10 MW of additional solar capacity on commercial buildings, and a 5.5% reduction in distance traveled by cars, below 2005 levels.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

            October 2015        In Seoul, a smart city project is using wide-ranging data to optimize public services to the needs of citizens and to address environmental concerns.Seoul has recognized that many of its environmental, social, and economic issues could be addressed by applying smarter information and communications technology (ICT) to the city’s public services and capitalizing on the widespread use of social media and mobile devices. Smart Seoul 2015 aims to effectively manage rapid changes in the urban environment and strategies for spearheading future ICT developments.Smart Seoul 2015 is a plan for the e-governance of Seoul that strives to create an innovative urban culture based on IT and data. Under the project, data, often generated by citizens themselves, help City of Seoul officials make more informed decisions and develop real-time, mobile-based services that cater to citizens’ diverse needs. As citizen access to digital data is vital for the project’s success, fast public Wi-Fi is available at 972 hotspots across Seoul, including throughout the city’s subway networks as well as parks and other public facilities.Data for the project is collected through various e-government functions and the country’s private sector. For instance, the available pool of big data on telephone calls and transportation helped the city revise and streamline nighttime bus routes along the five most trafficked routes, resulting in increased public satisfaction as well as reduced fuel consumption. Another initiative under the project is a mapping application providing 3D street information, which can be used to predict which areas will be most affected by floods, thereby enabling the development of preemptive flood-response measures.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

Cities100: San Francisco - Coupling Public Health and Climate Resilience
#################################################################################

            October 2015        San Francisco is linking health and climate change impacts under a program that aims to educate and empower citizens and public agencies to improve resilience.For the last decade, cities have invested in developing climate action plans to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, yet less attention has been paid to developing adaptive measures to protect public health during climate change-related extreme weather events. This program seeks to rebrand climate change as a public health issue and has partnered with city agencies to educate them about climate change health impacts.Climate change is expected to more seriously affect the health and well-being of communities that are least able to prepare for, cope with, and recover from the impacts, such as the fact that extreme heat days in San Francisco are projected to increase by up to 40 days per year. To address this challenge, the City and County of San Francisco’s Climate and Health Program is successfully addressing the public health impacts of climate change by leveraging data driven planning and health indicators to create policies around climate adaptation on a local level.By centralizing and formalizing the collection of neighborhood-level data, the program provides neighborhood organizations, city departments, and direct service providers a simple, streamlined way to access information on climate and health. The Community Resilience Index is a summary of 36 equally weighted indicators from nine categories, such as hazards, environment, housing, economy, and demography. The index scores are visualized on neighborhood-level maps on a website where all data is open-access. The innovative use of data and assessments has initiated a public dialogue on the link between climate change and health, and resulted in actions to strengthen community resilience.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

Cities100: Yokohama - City-wide Rollout of Smart Energy Management
#################################################################################

            October 2015        Deploying a world-leading smart city model city-wide within a few years puts Yokohama on track to be transformed into a low carbon metropolis with lower energy use, more renewable power, and cleaner transport.With increasing urbanization, Yokohama is experiencing fast growth that poses challenges in terms of energy use, traffic jams, air pollution, and an overall increase in greenhouse gas emissions. The YSCP strives to better manage energy use and mitigate climate change through a rapid deployment of smart energy infrastructure.In 2010, the Japanese City of Yokohama formulated the Yokohama Smart City Project (YSCP) as a five-year pilot in three city districts. It has since been deployed to the entire city of 3.7 million people. The YSCP applies smart grids for the energy management of households, buildings, and local communities; introduces large-scale renewable energy; and promotes green transportation systems.Under the project, energy management systems have been installed in 4,200 homes, resulting in a 20% reduction in energy consumption through visualization of energy use and curbing power demand by providing consumers with incentives to limit electricity use. Similarly, energy management systems in offices and commercial buildings have resulted in a 20% reduction in peak energy consumption. In addition, the project has introduced 2,300 electric vehicles, and installed charging stations throughout the city. The use of renewable energy sources is also a priority under the YSCP, aiming for solar power generation in 249 locations, wind power generation in two locations, hydropower generation in three locations, and biomass power generation in six locations.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

#################################################################################

            October 2015        Deploying a world-leading smart city model city-wide within a few years puts Yokohama on track to be transformed into a low carbon metropolis with lower energy use, more renewable power, and cleaner transport.With increasing urbanization, Yokohama is experiencing fast growth that poses challenges in terms of energy use, traffic jams, air pollution, and an overall increase in greenhouse gas emissions. The YSCP strives to better manage energy use and mitigate climate change through a rapid deployment of smart energy infrastructure.In 2010, the Japanese City of Yokohama formulated the Yokohama Smart City Project (YSCP) as a five-year pilot in three city districts. It has since been deployed to the entire city of 3.7 million people. The YSCP applies smart grids for the energy management of households, buildings, and local communities; introduces large-scale renewable energy; and promotes green transportation systems.Under the project, energy management systems have been installed in 4,200 homes, resulting in a 20% reduction in energy consumption through visualization of energy use and curbing power demand by providing consumers with incentives to limit electricity use. Similarly, energy management systems in offices and commercial buildings have resulted in a 20% reduction in peak energy consumption. In addition, the project has introduced 2,300 electric vehicles, and installed charging stations throughout the city. The use of renewable energy sources is also a priority under the YSCP, aiming for solar power generation in 249 locations, wind power generation in two locations, hydropower generation in three locations, and biomass power generation in six locations.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

Cities100: Salvador - Tax Rebate Incentivizes Building Green
#################################################################################

            October 2015        The Brazilian City of Salvador is using a discount on property taxes to incentivize the deployment of sustainable technologies in the building sectorSalvador has opted to confront one of the worst economic crises Brazil has endured in recent history by betting on the sustainability market as an economic leverage tool. Encouraging citizens and businesses to develop sustainable projects through reduced taxes will reward an environmental mindset, increase demand for sustainable technologies, and attract new business to the city.Salvador’s IPTU Verde is a property tax tied to a public certification scheme by which building construction and renovation projects are rated according to their investments in sustainable technologies and ability to reduce CO2 emissions. Projects gather points toward a bronze, silver, or gold certification, which awards the developer a 5%, 7%, or 10% discount on the property tax, respectively. The construction and renovation projects that pursue certification under the IPTU Verde are also prioritized under local government permitting of new developments.The sustainable technologies recognized under the IPTU Verde certification fall within the areas of water and waste management, energy efficiency, and alternative energy sources and range from natural lighting and ventilation to use of rainwater, and wind and solar energy generation. Through the increased demand generated by the IPTU Verde, Salvador aims to attract green companies and position the city as a hub for sustainable business.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

            October 2015        Paris’ green bonds, dubbed “climate bonds,” specifically target the financing of city climate action projects, with a first issuance worth $336 million.Prior to the introduction of climate bonds, more than $5.6 billion was invested in projects under the Paris Climate Action Plan through traditional bonds or loans. The climate bonds aim to persuade private and institutional investors to invest in the low carbon economy by providing attractive rates and guarantees, while securing finance for Paris’ extensive investment in climate change adaptation and mitigation.In November 2015, just before the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris, COP21, the City of Paris launched the first-ever city “climate bonds” – a variation of green bonds that focus solely on securing finance for city government climate change mitigation and adaptation projects. The $336 million issuance of climate bonds makes it one of the largest issuances of green city bonds to date. By raising funds through green bonds, Paris is sending a clear signal to the market and instilling confidence in suppliers of green products and servicesThe bonds finance projects in the Paris Climate Action Plan that aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 75% by 2050. Areas of action include renewable energy, building energy retrofits, mobility electrification, improved waste collection, water use demand management, and reduction of the urban heat island effect. Notable projects are a 20 GWh per year-saving retroﬁt of 200 schools, 300 charging points for electric vehicles, and the creation of a new electric bus rapid transit line, as well as urban farming and city greening programs.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

Cities100: London - Leveraging Private Funds to Reach City Climate Goals
#################################################################################

            October 2015        London has created a fund consisting of public and private sector money to finance projects needed to realize the climate, energy, and waste reduction targets of the city.Due to uncertain demand, implementation of emerging technologies, and long payback periods, the inability to secure funding is a key barrier to establishing low carbon infrastructure. The London Green Fund addresses the lack of investment in London’s waste and energy infrastructure by leveraging private sector funds to achieve the twin objectives of environmental goals and financial returns.London’s goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 60% by 2025 is estimated to cost $63 billion, which cannot be delivered by public sector investments alone. Therefore, the city established the London Green Fund, in which private funding, e.g. from pension funds and commercial banks, is combined with public money to finance sustainable infrastructure projects via equity finance and loans. By mid-2015, $165 million of public money, with support from the EU, had been invested in schemes valued at $1.1 billion – a leverage of seven times the public money invested. The fund is an efficient use of public resources as financial returns can be re-invested into similar projects.The fund has made 16 investments in energy efficiency, decentralized energy, and waste infrastructure between 2012 and 2015. The first stage of projects resulted in 35% energy savings compared to conditions before investment, while creating over 2,000 jobs. A further $780 million in EU funding has been earmarked for the second stage of the London Green Fund, and the intention is to combine this with $156 million from the European Investment Bank.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

            October 2015        Stockholm is tapping revenues from its congestion pricing scheme to raise funds for new metro lines that will service affordable housing developments.The population of Greater Stockholm is increasing by around 35,000 people per year. To accommodate this growth, the city plans to build around 10,000 apartments per year while increasing density and mix of uses. As the transport sector is responsible for around one-third of the city’s greenhouse gas emissions, Stockholm realized there was a need for integrated solutions to urban development in which new housing and public transit are intrinsically connected.Stockholm’s population is growing rapidly, causing an acute need for affordable housing and improved urban mobility. To tackle these challenges and lower CO2 emissions from the transportation sector, the Swedish capital has developed an integrated solution with an innovative financing model that taps into the revenues from the congestion pricing scheme. These revenues will be used to fund the construction of new metro lines to serve the residents of 78,000 apartments under construction in high-density, mixed use areas close to the urban core.Stockholm’s existing congestion pricing scheme was expanded in terms of price and geographic area to increase revenues in order to help fund the metro construction. The expanded congestion pricing scheme takes effect in 2016 and will reduce traffic levels as well as greenhouse gas emissions from road transport in Stockholm County. The expanded congestion pricing scheme will also reduce daily vehicle kilometers traveled by around 270,000.<em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

Cities100: São Paulo - Incentivizing Density Near Public Transit
#################################################################################

            October 2015        São Paulo has created a scheme that encourages new real estate developments near public transportation and holds developers accountable for their projects’ environmental footprints.São Paulo has been challenged by new commercial and residential developments being built in parts of the city with suboptimal existing public infrastructure. This scheme of charging developers according to a model that takes into account socio-economic factors, such as access to public transit, and environmental footprints drives real estate development toward areas of the city in need of investments.To promote more sustainable and transit-oriented urban development, São Paulo devised a scheme in which real estate developers must financially compensate the city for new developments based upon the value of the land, the cost of creating new urban infrastructure – particularly public transportation – and the environmental impacts of new construction. The scheme incentivizes mixed-use development in an effort to reduce the need for transport, while stimulating developments in less valued areas near existing public transportation. The plan also creates new economic opportunities in the city’s poorest neighborhoods.With the scheme raising $150 million per year, the city has been able to invest in projects such as bus rapid transit, subway, and train service, as well as create parks to reduce the urban heat island effect and improve rainwater management. São Paulo aims to have its entire municipal bus fleet run on renewable fuels by 2018, and the increased use of public transportation significantly contributes to the reduction of the city’s greenhouse gas emissions.<em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

#################################################################################

            October 2015        The Toronto Atmospheric Fund (TAF) is a city-owned agency that provides grants, makes loans, undertakes special projects, and creates partnerships to facilitate action on climate change.Two of Toronto’s largest greenhouse gas reduction opportunities – investment in energy efficiency and public transit – face major barriers due to competing capital needs in a city juggling multiple priorities. Establishing a permanent fund to address this long-term issue proved a solution to reduce emissions, improve air quality, and save the city $41 million in energy costTAF helps advance Toronto’s community-wide greenhouse gas and air pollution reduction targets. With more than 80% of its endowment invested in projects that have positive climate impacts, the fund is increasingly acting as an “impact investor,” mobilizing public and private capital toward investments that are not only financially sound, but socially and environmentally conscious. The fund’s investment returns have covered all TAF program expenses, at no cost to the taxpayer, since its establishment 25 years ago.TAF targets the transport and building energy sectors, as they are responsible for 41% and 48% of Toronto’s CO2 emissions, respectively. To unlock the significant local energy efficiency investment opportunities in buildings, TAF launched Efficiency Capital Corp. in 2015. This private venture will fund efficiency investments in Toronto’s building stock and raise up to $75 million in capital through third-party investors. To address transportation energy use, TAF funds a collective impact initiative called Move the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, consisting of 12 diverse civic groups who leverage provincial support for local transit. In 2014, their efforts helped secure a public commitment of almost $11.3 billion over 10 years for regional transit investments.<em>Environmental Benefits</em><em>Social Benefits</em><em>Economic Benefits</em><em>Health Benefits</em>Presented by C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40), Sustainia and Realdania – Available online and in print, Cities100 provides stakeholders an accessible format to explore achievable solutions for climate action in cities, and will be a useful tool for relevant groups ranging from impact investors and development organizations, to mayors and city governments.  You can access the full Cities100 2015 publication online

Milan's Area C reduces traffic pollution and transforms the city center
#################################################################################

            March 2015        The transport sector is a major contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide, and this is no different in the city of Milan. Although most people use public transport to get around Milan (57% of all trips in Milan are taken by public transport, 30% by cars, 7% by motorbike and 6% by bicycle), the city still has one of the highest European rates of car ownership and one of the highest concentrations of particulate matter among large European cities. It is for these critical reasons that the City of Milan launched several measures to address air pollution and traffic congestion. One such measure is an innovative road pricing scheme called Area C, a congestion charge aimed at reducing traffic pollution in the city of Milan and, consequently, improving quality of life for citizens and visitors alike.<a href="http://www.c40.org/blog_posts/milan%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Carea-c%E2%80%9D-program-cuts-air-pollution-traffic-congestion">Area C is a road pricing measure</a>Access to Area C is limited on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday from 7:30 to 19:30, and Thursday from 7:30 to 18:00. Cars entering Area C are detected by a system of 43 electronic gates (7 of which are reserved for public transport vehicles), equipped with ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) technology.A daily entrance ticket costs €5, which covers all accesses made by the same vehicle during that day. There are Mopeds, motorcycles, electric cars, vehicles for disabled people, public utility and public transport service vehicles, taxis, hybrid*, methane-powered*, LPG* and biofuel* cars are exempt from the charge.(*until 31/12/2016. From 01/01/2017 they will pay normal rates).<img alt="" data-spai="1" decoding="async" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCA0ODIgMjk4IiB3aWR0aD0iNDgyIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjI5OCIgZGF0YS11PSJodHRwcyUzQSUyRiUyRnd3dy5jNDAub3JnJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnN0YXRpYyUyRm90aGVyX3VwbG9hZHMlMkZpbWFnZXMlMkYxOTlfY2FzZV9zdHVkeV9NaWxhbl9jb25nZXN0aW9uX2NoYXJnZS5vcmlnaW5hbC5qcGclM0YxNDI3MjM2OTc5IiBkYXRhLXc9IjQ4MiIgZGF0YS1oPSIyOTgiIGRhdGEtYmlwPSIiPjwvc3ZnPg=="/>Area C has achieved important results in terms of mobility and the environment. Thus far, Area C has seen a 28% decrease in road congestion. In addition, a 24% reduction of all road casualties has been observed between 2011 and 2012, to be compared with an 11% reduction city-wide during the same period. Polluting vehicles are circulating less in the area: their numbers have decreased by 49% (-2,400 vehicles daily) and the share of cleaner vehicles has gone from 9.6 to 16.6% of the total traffic.There has been a significant reduction in concentrations of Black Carbon inside Area C compared to outside areas. Area C has also contributed to a reduction of the following pollutants:Overall, Area C has provided great benefits to the city: less congestion, traffic, pollution, noise, and more space for walking and cycling. The reduction of cars circulating in the city center has enabled public space once reserved for parking to be reclaimed by pedestrians. Moreover, thanks to the reduction in traffic from Area C, the city’s whole transport system has benefitted. In fact, according to a statement of AICAI (Courier Aircraft Association), Area C has resulted in a 10% increase in productivity of freight deliveries in the city center.Milan is finalizing its Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan, which outlines the possibility of extending Area C to the Cerchia Filoviaria (2nd cordon), and introducing a Low Emission Zone (LEZ), similar to that in force in London. Currently, the systems (camera and on-board units) are set to control and manage the heaviest vehicles and those used for the transport of dangerous goods. In a second phase, the city aims to also manage tourist buses and discourage the use of other, heavily polluting vehicles.Comune di MilanoAssessore Ambiente, Mobilità, Metropolitane,Acqua Pubblica, EnergiaPierfrancesco MaranVia Beccaria 1920121 Milanoassessore.maran@comune.milano.it

Nature Conservation Ordinance is Greening Tokyo’s Buildings
#################################################################################

            March 2015        Since 2000, the City of Tokyo has been taking measures to mitigate the impacts of the urban heat island effect, including covering roofs and walls with greenery in order to lower the surface temperature of buildings. To further these efforts, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government passed the Nature Conservation Ordinance in 2001, requiring the greening of building roofs and walls in addition to ground-level greenings for all new construction as well as existing buildings undergoing renovations.According to the Nature Conservation Ordinance, greening areas must be provided on the premises and on rooftops when buildings are newly constructed, repaired or extended to an area larger than 1,000 mThe first stage of the Nature Conservation Ordinance required 20% green coverage for buildings with a gross floor area of over 1,000 mTo popularize the Ordinance, the City of Tokyo conducted media outreach and advertised the conservation ordinance and compliance requirements widely and has played a leading role in keeping public awareness high.Tokyo’s goal is to install 1,000 hectares (10 million square meters) of greenery by 2016, both on rooftops and at the ground level.The City continues to work on the key task of maintaining the stakeholders’ attention and enthusiasm in order to keep these measures/efforts moving forward. Tokyo is also piloting more specification on the type of greening required, looking at cooling and other biodiversity benefits of various species, and looking at additional ways to put large scale, long-term urban heat island mitigation projects in place.Yuko Doi, Bureau of Environment, Tokyo Metropolitan Government<a href="mailto:Yuuko_Doi@member.metro.tokyo.jp">Yuuko_Doi@member.metro.tokyo.jp</a>Kanako Okano, Bureau of Environment, Tokyo Metropolitan Government<a href="mailto:Kanako_Okano@member.metro.tokyo.jp">Kanako_Okano@member.metro.tokyo.jp</a>

Stockholm Royal Seaport
#################################################################################

            January 2015        The Stockholm Royal Seaport (SRS) project is transforming the old industrial port area into a modern city environment for both residents and businesses, setting the standard for creating a fossil-fuel free Stockholm. The project will improve the city’s sustainability by providing 12,000 apartments and 35,000 work places, which will be combined with space for recreation, thereby creating a dynamic and vibrant living and working space.A Due to increasing competition between cities and regions, SRS is becoming a hub in the Baltic region. The seaport’s strategic location as the gateway to Stockholm, as well as its location in the center of the fast-expanding Baltic region, has increased the need to update the port’s infrastructure to accommodate rising ferry and cruise line traffic.In 2009, the City Council of Stockholm decided that the Stockholm Royal Seaport should become a new environmentally profiled district. The aim of the project is to transform the old industrial port area into a modern city environment for both residents and businesses. Close cooperation between public authorities, developers, industry and universities, resulted in six focus areas, including energy, transportation, climate adaptation, eco-cycle systems, and sustainable housing.The city, building off of the success of the Hammarby Sjostad project, set out aggressive goals for SRS, including:The project targets will be achieved through close cooperation with developers, utilities and other stakeholders. Requirements in land allocation agreements, combined with monitoring and follow-up processes ensure that houses are built according to passive house standards, wherein local renewable energy is generated, waste is recycled and local storm water management is built on properties. The city ensures that the transport network enables sustainable choices by prioritizing walking, biking and public transport, as well as encouraging recycling and renewable energy production.Stockholm was selected as the first European Green Capital in 2010, demonstrating the steps Stockholm has already taken towards achieving environmental sustainability.The SRS is, and will continue to be, an important part of the city’s economic growth. For example, the port itself receives a few thousand visitors every day and the 120-year old gasworks will be transformed into a public area containing a culture centre with an international stage, museum, and public amenities. The urban green structure will connect the northern and southern part of the Royal National Park and contribute to a resilient ecosystem, recreation and an aesthetic urban environment.Since 2007, citizen participation has also been a key component of the SRS. Public consultations and open house informational meetings, as well as mail surveys and meetings with residents living in the surrounding city districts, have ensured input from the public.<a href="http://bygg.stockholm.se/Alla-projekt/norra-djurgardsstaden/In-English/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://bygg.stockholm.se/Alla-projekt/norra-djurgardsstaden/In-English/</a><a href="http://stockholmroyalseaport.com/en/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://stockholmroyalseaport.com/en/</a>

Increasing Biodiversity and Community in Changwon
#################################################################################

            January 2015        Changwon’s Rapid industrialization in South Korea since the early 1970s has resulted in heavy air, water, and soil pollution and has caused serious disruption to traditional communities whose livelihoods are largely based on agriculture. Simultaneously, demographic changes have led to high-density populations in urban areas, traffic congestion, increased property values and a higher cost of living.These demographic shifts are in part due to the 2010 consolidation of three urban areas into one, when over one million people were voluntarily integrated into one urban area. This poses an additional challenge of how to integrate different groups into one community.With the shift to an urban way of life, a growing trend has seen a majority of citizens’ living in apartments, a factor influenced by a general decline in household sizes whilst life expectancy has increased. This has also enhanced social cohesion as neighbours were previously more isolated.City officials established the ‘2020 Environmental Project’ in 2006, setting the goal of reducing carbon emissions by 30% by 2020. The 2020 Environmental Project outlined four goals and eight strategies to improve the biodiversity of the city, including expanding the city’s green spaces, maintaining parks and rivers, developing a green transit system, improving recycling, increasing the renewable energy supply and building eco-communities.One example of the 2020 Environmental Project in action is the ‘Eutteum Neighbourhood Building Project’, which is a voluntary citizen participation project that empowers communities to find local solutions to local problems. Throughout the city’s 62 administrative districts, the neighbourhood committees (consisting of citizens, experts, and local officials) identify community-specific challenges and solutions. To date, 980 committee members, including the leaders and the activists of the projects, have participated in the program by suggesting and creating environmental initiatives to be implemented within their local community. As part of the project, residents compete for public funding with project proposals that aim to improve living conditions, curb pollution, and promote green lifestyles in the urban environment.For the Eutteum Neighbourhood Building Project, close to 14,000 tons of COThe success of the Sustainable Community Building Project Strategy is evident by the fact that 132 community projects were implemented in 2012 alone.Projects range from organic roof top gardens, enhanced water quality, tree planting, biodiversity and creating more green spaces. Some communities also created flea markets to improve recycling habits. All projects are geared towards creating urban spaces rich in biodiversity and improving the resiliency of the city by decreasing carbon consumption, improving waste management and recycling, and supplying safe food supplies.The ‘Green Apartments Competition’, encourages residents living in apartment dwellings to live greener lifestyles by through such efforts as make energy savings and reduce their water usage, encourage walking and cycling, and support efforts to restore local communities through improved cooperation and communications. Other projects focus on the environmental quality of the surrounding areas, such as cleaning river streams within local communities by planting aquatic plants to improve the water quality and biodiversity of the streams.A key factor in the success of the program is the creation of a new administrative structure to stimulate greater citizen participation by encouraging citizens to organize their own community events and identify local projects of importance to the community. Thanks to these strategic approaches, ‘The Citizens Self-autonomy Committee’ – organized by local citizens – was established in every neighbourhood. The goal of the committee is to find solutions to community issues and environmental problems, in addition to inspiring the implementation of local activities and projects. The neighbourhood community network was launched with 200 people to build neighbourhood leaders’ capacity and supply opportunities for better education.In addition, project organizers have educated roughly 500 ‘Green Leaders’ per year. These Green Leaders are key to educating the wider community about climate change and advising on community initiatives and activities. A further 1,000 citizens were engaged in leadership training and community-based project groups, resulting in a more sustainable commitment from the local community. Finally, the project has a strong social component achieved by engaging women, youth and the elderly as project leaders, thereby empowering groups more susceptible to being marginalized.<a href="http://unpan3.un.org/unpsa/Public_NominationProfilev2014.aspx?id=2351">http://unpan3.un.org/unpsa/Public_NominationProfilev2014.aspx?id=2351</a><a href="http://changwoncity.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/changwon-cited-for-green-growth/">http://changwoncity.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/changwon-cited-for-green-growth/</a><a href="http://www.c40.org/cities/changwon">http://www.c40.org/cities/changwon</a>

Portland's Healthy Connected Neighbourhood Strategy
#################################################################################

            January 2015        The goal of the Healthy Connected Neighbourhood Strategy is to bring complete neighbourhoods to 80% of the city’s population by 2035. The Strategy is integrated into the main Over the last 30 years, Portland has experienced substantial growth. It grew from more than 200,000 residents, to 600,000 residents, and annexed adjacent land that did not have the same quality of infrastructure as pre-existing areas. The population growth resulted in a more diverse population; however, some of these communities did not have as much equitable access to amenities and economic opportunities.In addition to projected population growth, Portland is challenged by its historic development pattern. Inner neighbourhoods developed in an era of streetcars and are relatively compact; however, large parts of the city developed as automobiles were becoming common and are less well-suited for pedestrians. As a result, transportation is responsible for 40% of Portland’s greenhouse gas emissions. Portland is making steady progress in reducing vehicle miles travelled and shifting to active transportation modes, but neighbourhood patterns are slow to change and require decades of careful planning and investment. The Healthy Connected Neighbourhood Strategy is designed to accelerate the shift to active transportation modes, simultaneously revitalizing neighbourhoods and realising the health, affordability, and liveability benefits of transit, walking, and cycling.The goal of the Healthy Connected Neighbourhood Strategy is to bring complete neighbourhoods to 80% of the city’s population by 2035. The strategy is a key part of the In order to achieve the measures of success, the Healthy Connected Neighbourhoods Strategy focuses on three goals:To accomplish these goals, the city created the ‘20-minutes Neighbourhood Analysis’ to assess the ‘completeness’ of neighbourhoods, and analyse the walkability and access to services across the city. The analysis considers both the proximity to local amenities, parks, schools, etc., and the ability to access these destinations in terms of street connectivity, sidewalks, transit service and topography. This information serves to evaluate progress towards the Healthy Connected Neighbourhood goals and diagnose specific investment needs in different areas of the city.The Portland Plan is designed to prioritize and align city budget decisions rather than require new funding. The plan provides the City of Portland with a coordinated and measurable approach in organizing and prioritizing city budget requests and helps prioritize work with other agencies and organizations.When fully implemented, the new budget approach will direct City of Portland bureaus and offices to (1) identify how programs and projects support the Portland Plan strategies and specific actions, (2) use an asset management approach to achieve more equitable service levels across communities and geographies, (3) track and report on service levels and investments by community and geography, including expanding the budget mapping process, and (4) coordinate City budgets with local, state and federal agencies. Each fiscal year, the partners will review the actions and determine which actions are the highest priorities.As of 2012, Portland’s carbon emissions have decreased to 11.5% below 1990 levels, despite 27% population growth.The application of the Healthy Connected Neighbourhood Strategy has resulted in the tree canopy level increasing from 27.3% to 29.9% since 2000. In terms of the goal of achieving 70% mode split for transit, walking and bicycling by 2035, 27% of trips are currently taken by these modes. As of 2014, Portland saves more than $1 billion annually as a result of driving less than other American cities. Furthermore, citizen participation is a key component of the Healthy Connected Neighbourhood strategy. From individuals and community groups to schools and businesses, Portlanders all contributed to the development of the project with more than 20,000 comments and ideas for the plan.<a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bps/article/353238?archive=2011-06">https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bps/article/353238?archive=2011-06</a><a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/portlandplan/">http://www.portlandonline.com/portlandplan/</a>Josh Alpert, Policy Director, Mayor’s Office

Industrial Area Transformed: Hammarby Sjöstad
#################################################################################

            January 2015        The Hammarby Sjöstad project is a recognized model in urban regeneration of a brownfield site made up of a former industrial area. When complete in 2017, the project will have about 12,000 residential units, housing roughly 28,000 people and providing 10,000 working units.Stockholm, elected Europe’s The Hammarby Sjöstad project began in the 1990s as a way to meet the sustainable housing and infrastructure needs of the city’s growing population. The project has involved regenerating an old industrial and harbour area into a modern mixed-used space that has a low environmental impact. When complete in 2017, the project will have about 12,000 residential units, housing some 28,000 people and 10,000 working units.Hammarby Sjöstad operates according to its own ‘eco-cycle’, the Hammarby Model, which outlines environmental solutions for waste, energy, water and sewage. The aim is to have half the total environmental impact compared to similar districts built during the 1990s. In order to achieve that, the project has six main goal areas:A commissioned study in 2008 found that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from buildings were around 40-46% lower than the 1990 baseline set, and those from transport were 48% lower (source: Nearly Complete. Lessons learned are influencing future development in Stockholm and around the world.The Hammarby Sjöstad project is due to be completed in 2017, with approximately 20,000 residents at present. A commissioned study in 2008 found that the project had already come very close to its stated goals (source: Grontmij, The study also found that 79% of Hammarby’s population walked, cycled or took public transport to work – just 1% off the project’s 80% target and lower than an already-high 68% for Stockholm as a whole. Other indicators, in areas such as air pollution, waste and water consumption also scored well below 1990s levels.The Hammarby project has proven inspirational to cities around the world, spurring ambitious goals in other port and industrial regeneration projects in Stockholm, at the Stockholm Royal Seaport, and in Copenhagen, Oslo, Toronto and New York City.<a href="http://issuu.com/siemens_the_crystal/docs/stockholm_hammarby___jaerva_sustain?e=3714297/4945801" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://issuu.com/siemens_the_crystal/docs/stockholm_hammarby___jaerva_sustain?e=3714297/4945801</a><a href="http://hammarbysjostad.se/?lang=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://hammarbysjostad.se/?lang=en</a><a href="http://bygg.stockholm.se/Alla-projekt/hammarby-sjostad/In-english/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://bygg.stockholm.se/Alla-projekt/hammarby-sjostad/In-english/</a>GlashusEttglashusett@hammarbysjostad.se

As of January 2014 the program had supported a total of 112 projects totaling 233,000 square metres, reducing energy consumption by an estimated 565 MWh, avoiding 106 tonnes of greenhouse gases and diverting 8.7 million litres of storm water annually from the sewers.The Eco-Roof Incentive Program complements Toronto’s The Eco-Roof Incentive Program provides funding for existing buildings, and new buildings not required to construct a green roof as part of the Green Roof Bylaw. Buildings must be located in the city of Toronto.Eligible green roof projects will receive $75 / square metre up to a maximum of $100,000.Eligible cool roof projects will receive $2-5 / square metre up to a maximum of $50,000.The Eco-Roof Incentive Program provides funds for green roof projects on:To be eligible for the Eco-Roof Incentive Program, a green roof must meet the following specifications:The Eco-Roof Incentive Program provides funds for cool roof projects on existing residential, industrial, commercial, and institutional buildings that meet the following specifications:The program grants are funded by fees paid by developers under the Green Roof Bylaw.In 2013 the program was expanded to include the residential sector. As a result there has been an increase in applications and uptake of green roofs from this sector. It is expected that this trend will continue as more property owners embrace eco-roof technology.In 2015 City Council will be presented with a report that will discuss the outcomes of the program and make recommendations for increasing uptake of the program.Annemarie BayntonEmail: Mailing address:

Melbourne's Growing Green Guide
#################################################################################

            January 2015        The The Growing Green Guide (‘the Guide’) is a thoroughly researched, accessible guidebook that promotes green surfaces and explains how to create high quality green roofs, walls and facades to the public and professionals who may be involved in the design, construction and maintenance of them. The guidelines cover benefits for building owners and the public, and provide case studies, in order to broaden awareness and understanding.The Guide has been released in conjunction with a Growing Green policy options paper for local councils and state government and a number of demonstration projects. The three-part project is the result of a compilation of evidence from around the world (including programs in Toronto, Portland and Seattle and studies done in Athens and Brazil). As the policy paper indicates, the three-pronged approach aims to exemplify, enable, engage and encourage the implementation of green roofs and walls.Led by the City of Melbourne, the project is a joint initiative of the inner Melbourne Action Plan councils (IMAP): Melbourne, Yarra, Stonnington and Port Philip along with the University of Melbourne. This project was funded through the Victorian Government’s Victorian Adaptation and Sustainability Partnership, and through the IMAP Councils.The Guide provides practical methods for implementing the policy behind green roofs, walls and facades. It will help to increase the number of high quality, multifunctional green roofs, walls and facades to make our cities more liveable and sustainable. It is relevant to developers, homeowners, and local and state governments, and is targeted at projects based in Melbourne and Victoria, Australia. There are currently around 50 green walls, 100 green roofs and many green facades across Melbourne – and the numbers are growing.Currently, Melbourne is introducing green roof and façade elements into the planning schemes at the state level. The next step will be to consider supporting financial incentives for larger and medium size buildings – most likely from charges collected from tree removal – before likely moving on to introduce an ordinance to require a certain amount of greening per development.Yvonne Lynch, Team Leader, Urban Forest and Urban Ecology, Urban Landscapes, Gail Hall, Green Infrastructure Coordinator, Urban Landscapes,

Greening the BIDs: Private-public collaboration to deliver green infrastructure opportunities
#################################################################################

            January 2015        The Greater London Authority (GLA) is working with Greening the BIDs is an innovative public-private sector programme that combines the strategic overview of the Mayor with the delivery capacity of BIDs and their members to ‘green’ business districts in central London. The aim is to make these areas, which are of economic importance as well as home to many Londoners, both more visually attractive and more resilient to extreme weather. Greening the BIDs therefore promotes the interlinked social, economic and environmental benefits of green infrastructure.The Mayor has set an ambitious target of increasing the amount of green cover in central London by 5% by 2030 and by 10% by 2050 (based on a 2008 baseline). Enhancing or increasing the number of trees, parks, gardens and living roofs make areas more attractive to visit and work in, and help urban areas become more resilient to extreme weather events, which helps to preserve economic sustainability.In order to meet the mayoral greening target, green infrastructure must be delivered though both new developments and retrofit of the existing built environment.
